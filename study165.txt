Impact of Personal Characteristics, College Environment, and College Life Jisung Yoo 1  Abstract  This study examines the determinants influencing students’ decisions to drop out or stop out (i.e., withdraw temporarily) from colleges in South Korea. Using Korean Education and Employment Panel II survey data (2016–2019), the determinants of students’ college discontinuance of 8,485 students were analyzed and categorized as personal, college environmental, and college life factors, and for this purpose, binary logistic regression analysis was employed. Results showed that college aca- demic performance, psychological stability, and college satisfaction influenced dropping out. Also, gender, parental income, college performance, college location, and satisfaction with the college department were found to influence students’ deci- sions to stop out. Particularly noteworthy, this study revealed the significant impact of the Korean cultural belief that success can only be achieved after graduating from one of the top colleges in the Seoul or Gyeonggi Province area. Strategies at the government and college levels are proposed to address the continuing problem of college dropouts and stopouts.  Plain language summary  This study examines the various factors that influence students’ decisions to drop out or stop out (i.e., withdraw temporarily) from colleges in South Korea. Korea Research Institute for Vocational Education and Training survey data collected from 8,485 college students in 2016 to 2019 were analyzed using binary logistic regression to identify personal, college environmental, and college life factors that could influence students’ discontinuation of college study. The results showed that college academic performance, psychological stability, and college satisfaction influenced dropping out, while gender, parental income, college performance, college location, and satisfaction with the college department influenced stopping out. The study also revealed the important influence of the common Korean cultural belief that success can only be achieved after graduating from one of the top colleges in the Seoul or Gyeonggi Province area. As this study was limited to the examination of factors influencing college discontinuation in South Korea, future studies providing data from other countries and possibly identifying additional influential factors are recommended. One important implication of this study is the need for effective strategies at the government and college levels to address the continuing problem of college dropouts and stopouts.

(discontinuing college for a particular reason and later re-enrolling); opt out (leaving college after achieving a particular goal but no completing a degree); and transfer out (leaving a college and transferring to another institu- tion before degree completion). Although   some   students   may   opt   out   of   college because they feel they have achieved their primary edu- cational goal and do not need to complete a degree pro- gram, this type of college withdrawal is rare in Korea. Also, college students in Korea may decide to withdraw in order to transfer out to a higher-ranked institution, to change their career path, or to pursue additional educa- tional opportunities or a specific certificate, such as lan- guage training and internship. In the current study, Hoyt and Winn’s (2004) four categories are collapsed more simply into two categories, drop out (permanent with- drawal) and stop out (temporary withdrawal). The cur- rent study employs this dichotomous approach for the analysis of college discontinuation. This study aims to help fill the gap in the literature on college discontinuation in Korea. Specifically, the pur- pose of this study is to examine the determinants that affect college students’ academic cessation (drop out and stop out) in Korea by using data from the Korean Education and Employment Panel (KEEP II) survey. Furthermore, the influence of personal, college environ- mental, and college life factors are examined in a multi- dimensional   manner.   Through   this   examination,   this study offers suggestions for governmental and college- level efforts necessary to prevent and manage college stu- dents’ academic discontinuation.  Literature Review  Factors Influencing College Discontinuation  As previous studies (e.g., E. Lee & Kwak, 2011) examin- ing college discontinuation in Korea did not distinguish between cases of stop out or drop out and rather treated them as a single case, these studies are limited with respect to identifying the determinants. It is sometimes difficult to classify a particular withdrawal as a drop out or a stop out, given that at the point in time when a stu- dent withdraws there is a possibility that the student will resume their studies later. The reasons for temporary school withdrawals are varied. For example, in Korea, many   male   college   students   discontinue   their   college studies temporarily to meet their country’s 2-year mili- tary service requirement (M. Kim, 2021). Tinto (1975), the first scholar to theorize college stu- dents’   academic   discontinuation,   developed   a   model emphasizing that college discontinuation was not caused by a single factor, but by a combination of individual characteristics and various environmental factors related to their respective educational institutions (Tinto, 1993). These diverse influences can be categorized as personal characteristics, college environmental factors, and college life factors. As most previous Korean studies made no distinction between stopouts and dropouts, it should be noted that in the following discussion, the term   dropout   is used as a general term to refer to college discontinuation.  Personal Characteristics.   Personal characteristics reflect the individual demographic factors including gender, age, year of study in college, high school type, major, and admissions type. Among the studies examining the impact of gender on school dropouts in Korea, the results have varied. While many provided evidence that male students had a higher rate of college discontinuation than female students, even excluding military leave (M. Kim, 2021; E. Lee &Kang, 2019), other studies found that female stu- dents had a higher dropout rate (Song & Kim, 2019; Yeon & Jang, 2015). Furthermore, some studies showed that gender had no effect on college discontinuation (K. Kim & Oh, 2021; E. Lee et al., 2020). Several studies examining the correlation between the type of high school they attended (humanities, specialized high schools, etc.) and discontinuation of study showed that vocational high school graduates had a higher drop- out rate than graduates of humanities high schools (Lim, 2020). In contrast, E. Lee and Kang (2019) found the highest dropout rate for students from high schools with accredited academic background, followed by students from employment-oriented high schools (e.g., specialized high schools such as agricultural/fishery industry high schools), and special purpose high schools (e.g., foreign language, science). In addition, some studies investigated the relationship between college discontinuation and students of different majors. For example,K. Kim and Oh (2021) found that freshmen majoring in Tourism and Culture had a lower dropout intention than those in other departments. Park (2012) showed that the dropout rate of engineering stu- dents admitted from vocational high schools was higher than that of students from academic high schools. Some previous studies focused on the relationship between college discontinuation and the effects of non- academic characteristics such as gender, high school type, and admission type, and academic characteristics such as grades. E. Lee and Kang (2019) found that the female dropout rate has been increasing. H. Lee and Kim (2018) showed that students admitted based on college entrance exams performed better but were not as well-adjusted to campus life, compared to students admitted based on other factors such as GPA, teacher’s evaluation, and let- ters of self-introduction. In addition, research on individual cognitive traits revealed that poor academic ability, low high school grades, low college entrance exam scores, low college  Yoo   3

emotional problems and psychological instability (e.g., depression) affect attitudes and thoughts related to col- lege adjustment, and thus act as a major cause of study suspension (e.g., E. Lee et al., 2020). One possible expla- nation for the current study’s finding about the relation- ship   between   students’   psychological   stability   and tendency to drop out is that these students may have the desire to leave their current institution to pursue more stimulating academic study at another institution or to seek a challenging career. Government-supported poli- cies are needed to enable all colleges to develop and pro- vide curriculum, programs, and state-of-the-art facilities and instructional equipment that will help them compete with the higher-ranked institutions. Second,   the   negative   relationship   between   college satisfaction and dropout indicates that students who are less satisfied with their college are more likely to drop out. This finding is consistent with other studies that show that low satisfaction with college life and difficul- ties in adapting to college life determine academic discon- tinuation (e.g., Hwang, 2020; Kang et al., 2019; M. Kim, 2021). Efforts are needed to increase college life satisfac- tion of students at both the college and department levels to address the drop out problem. For example, the col- lege needs to conduct a college life satisfaction survey for freshmen and develop a systematic management system to track and help new students with low satisfaction through counseling and assistance in establishing a career path. The department should provide a welcome party and counseling for new students with advisors, counsel- ing for current students with career advisors, and men- toring for seniors preparing for the next step of their career path. Major factors affecting the stopout of college students were also identified in this study. First, regarding per- sonal factors, the influence of parental income was found to be weak but statistically significant. Parents’ higher education and income levels may cause their children to stop out for the purpose of moving to a higher-ranked college, for changing their career path, or for additional experiences beyond a college degree that better prepare them for their career (e.g., internships). Several studies have reported that parents’ low economic level, lack of ability to afford tuition, and difficulties in obtaining tui- tion increase the probability of college discontinuation (K. Kim & Oh, 2021) while scholarship support lowers this possibility (M. Kim, 2021). Therefore, the govern- ment and colleges should prepare various scholarship systems to help socially and economically disadvantaged students maintain a stable college life. College grades were also found to have a negative relationship with stopouts, which means that students with lower grades tend to stop out. Hwang (2020) found that students thought that grades were an important factor influencing employment, especially students with poor grades in their first year of study. These students thought that they should discontinue college or prepare for a different career that does not require good college grades. This finding points to the need for colleges to provide counseling for students who perceive that find- ing a job is too stressful and that low grades will lead to failure in securing employment after graduation. On the other hand, students who stop out due to low college grades can be seen as lacking aptitude and interest in their major. Therefore, colleges should provide educa- tional support to allow students to explore their interests and possible majors as well as their identity, vision, goals, and career direction. Second, among the college environmental factors, it was found that students who attend 2-year colleges tend to stop out, compared with those attending 4-year col- leges. In fact, the rate of college discontinuation at 2-year colleges has been increasing at the recently recorded rate of 7.6%, which is almost twice as high as 4.3% at general colleges (4-year college) in the same year (Song & Kim, 2019). In 2-year colleges, students have a limited choice of majors and liberal arts classes because the roadmap for required major courses is more limited and straight- forward. In addition, the implicit atmosphere of the col- lege and department culture at 2-year colleges makes it difficult for students to freely utilize the academic system such as extending their study to add a minor or double major. Efforts should be made by both 2-year colleges and the government to improve and expand the curricu- lum and programs, leading to greater student satisfaction and greater career success. Regarding college location, it was shown that students who   did   not   attend   colleges   in   Seoul   or   Gyeonggi Province tended to stop out. The trend toward more stu- dents wanting to attend colleges in Seoul and Gyeonggi is expected to accelerate in the future. Korea’s educa- tional culture and the myth that success can only be achieved after graduating from a prestigious university, that is, one located in Seoul, seem to affect college stu- dent dropouts and stopouts. The government should promote various policies that ensure that students gradu- ating from colleges in other local areas are not discrimi- nated against in employment. For example, government policy can expand measures to give additional benefits to companies and public institutions that hire local talent. Third, regarding college life factors, the results indicate that students with lower department satisfaction or lower college satisfaction tend to stop out. Accordingly, sys- tematic management and support from universities for students who stop out are required. Colleges, as well as the government, should make the effort to find out why students stop out and come up with systematic and com- prehensive measures and policies to address this problem.  10   SAGE Open

Introduction  The number of students discontinuing their academic study at colleges and universities in Korea has been gra- dually increasing and thus has been recognized as a seri- ous   national   problem.   High   dropout   rates   not   only threaten the survival of a nation’s universities but also negatively impact a nation’s economic, social, and cul- tural development (Ministry of Education, 2018). The dropout rate of students at 4-year colleges in 2020 was 6.1%, an increase from 3.6% in 2000 and 4.0% in 2013. Even at junior colleges the dropout rate increased from 4.6% in 2000% to 7.6% in 2013, and rose significantly to 8.8% in 2020 (Higher Education in Korea, n.d.). Considering that the dropout rate of elementary, middle, and high schools is 0.9% (Ministry of Education, 2018), the current dropout rate of students from institutions of higher education is alarmingly high. The issue of dropouts has continued to be a serious social issue in many other countries, including the U.S. According to data from the U.S. National Center for Education   Statistics   (National   Center   for   Education Statistics [NCES], 2020), the 2018 dropout rate of 4-year college students in the U.S. was about 19% and the gra- duation rate was only about 60%. Efforts have been made to address this problem and support academic suc- cess at the college level. On the other hand, in Korea, the discussion of discontinuing one’s college studies was not treated as an important topic until the 2000s. As a result, studies focusing on the factors influencing college discon- tinuation in Korea have been increasing since informa- tion on dropouts and students at risk of dropping out due to their low grades began to be included as items on college   self-evaluations   required   by   the   Ministry   of Education (Cha & Lee, 2019). Most Korean government policies and support systems related to school disconti- nuation are mainly supported and operated for elemen- tary, middle, and high schools (M. Kim, 2021), while colleges must rely solely on their own efforts to solve the problem   of   academic   discontinuation   (Soh   &   Kim, 2015). Generally, in Korea, a 2-year institution of higher education is referred to as a   college , while a 4-year insti- tution is referred to as a   university . In this paper, the term   college   refers to both a 2-year college and a 4-year university for the sake of simplicity. An examination of studies exploring the question of why students in Korea discontinue their college educa- tion reveals a number of research limitations. First, few studies have examined the causes of college students’ dis- continuation as a complex action of various dimensions. Three   major   dimensions   revealed   by   such   studies (e.g.,Astin, 1964; Bernardo et al., 2016; Tinto, 1975) and utilized in the Korean Education and Employment Panel II survey as well as in the current study include personal characteristics, college environment, and college life, but few studies have comprehensively looked at the impact of these three dimensions. Second, few studies have been conducted on college students who actually discontinued their college educa- tion in Korea. That is, most studies investigating the causes of dropouts have been conducted on current stu- dents who intended to drop out and not those who actu- ally dropped out (E. Lee & Kang, 2019). However, the intention to consider performing a specific behavior does not necessarily lead to the implementation of the actual behavior (Ajzen et al., 2004). Thus, there is a limit to directly exploring the cause of the actual academic inter- ruption only by identifying the factors influencing the intention to drop out (E. Lee et al., 2020). Third, most existing studies focusing on college dis- continuation in Korea do not distinguish between cases of dropout (permanent withdrawal) and stopout (tempo- rary withdrawal), but rather treat them as a single aca- demic interruption. Thus, such studies are limited in that the determinants of academic interruption for each— dropout and stopout—could not be identified. In con- trast, an NCES (1998) report distinguished dropouts from   stopouts   among   college   students   in   the   U.S. Compared to college stopouts, students who stayed out after leaving in their first year of college were more likely to be older, to have children, to work full time, and to be less academically integrated into their program of study. Fourth, few studies have analyzed the causes of college students’ academic interruption using panel data. Because the causes of academic interruption vary depending on the period (i.e., early or mid-term of college admission), a longitudinal study examining the change trend may be more suitable than a cross-sectional study (Gury, 2011). In cross-sectional studies focusing on a specific point in time, there is a limitation in understanding the process of change in dropout intention, that is, the possibility that factors affecting dropout intention and dropout over time may differ (Singer & Willett, 1993; Voelkle & Sander, 2008). Despite the contribution of longitudinal studies on college discontinuation conducted in Korea (e.g.,Kang et al., 2019; Y. S. Kim & Lee, 2022), research providing an understanding of the growing problem of college drop- outs and stopouts in Korea is still at a rudimentary stage (Yeon & Jang, 2015). In most countries, the term   drop out   is used as an umbrella term referring to withdrawing from college due to either external forces (e.g., lack of funds, family situa- tions) or lack of a student’s will. The concept of college discontinuation   has   been   defined   in   various   ways depending on the interests of the researchers and the data processing methods. Hoyt and Winn (2004) classi- fied college discontinuation into four types based on the reasons and characteristics: drop out (leaving college before   completing   a   degree   program);   stop   out  2   SAGE Open

grades, and poor learning attitude are among the main factors influencing college discontinuation. Studies of female college students in Korea confirmed that low col- lege grades were an important determinant of academic dropout (e.g., Joung, 2020;P. Lee, 2012). E.   Lee   and   Kang   (2019)   revealed   the   interaction among college grades, basic learning ability, and college discontinuation in Korea. A comparison of the academic background   characteristics   of   dropouts   and   students who continue their college study showed that not only were the college grades of dropouts lower, but there were also different patterns by college and gender. For exam- ple, students at engineering colleges with lower grades in mathematics had a higher dropout rate, while at liberal arts colleges a higher dropout rate was reported for those with lower Korean or English grades. Regarding the influence of psychological characteris- tics, emotional instability such as depression and anxiety has been shown to negatively affect students’ adjustment to college life, which in turn may lead to their decision to drop out (E. Lee et al., 2020; Meilman et al., 1992; Napoli & Wortman, 1998). Depression in college stu- dents can lead to lowered academic ability and lower academic   achievement,   increasing   the   likelihood   that they will be unable to adapt to school life (J. Choi et al., 1999; M. Roh et al., 2006). In addition, students suffer- ing from emotional instability have difficulties in social interaction and have interpersonal problems, making it difficult to adjust to college life (Coyne, 1976; Kown et al., 2010). Many studies examining determinants of college dis- continuation have focused on socioeconomic (SES) fac- tors. Kang et al. (2019) argued that children of wealthier parents with greater interest in their children’s college education had a higher intention to drop out of their cur- rent college and seek admission to a higher ranked insti- tution. Some studies (e.g.,Choi, 2010; Kim, 2008) showed that college students whose parents had a high educa- tional level and income had a higher dropout rate due to their desire to attend a higher ranked college for better educational and career opportunities. Other studies (e.g., G. Choi & Ham, 2010; K. Kim & Oh, 2021) revealed that the intention to discontinue college is higher among stu- dents whose parents have a low income level and those unable to obtain other financial support such as student loans and scholarships. Studies in other countries have also focused on per- sonal characteristics as factors influencing college discon- tinuation. Regarding the influence of year of study, Sosu and Pheunpha (2019) found that almost 20% of students in Thailand left college in the beginning of their second year, compared to 10% of students leaving between their second and final year. Further, Parker (2021) reported that the reasons for college discontinuation in the U.S. varied across racial groups, with 52% Hispanic students citing inability to afford college as the main reason, com- pared to White (39%) or Black (41%) students. The Brookings Institution also reported a recent gender gap in   the   U.S.   in   college   completion   rates.   In   the 2018 to 2019   academic   year,   over   1.1 million   women completed a bachelor’s degree compared to fewer than 860,000 men (Reeves & Smith, 2021).  College Environmental Factors.   College environmental fac- tors include the type of college (university, 2-year college), the   location   of   the   college   (metropolitan   area,   non- metropolitan area), and the characteristics and size of the college. Regarding the type of college, it was found that students at 2-year institutions were more likely to drop out of school than those at universities (S. Kim, 2008). From 2010 to recently, the dropout rate at 2-year colleges in Korea was 7.1% to 7.7%, which is almost twice as high as the rate at universities (3.9%–4.3%) (Song & Kim, 2019). Studies examining the location of the college as an envi- ronmental factor found that students at non-metropolitan colleges tended to prefer admission to institutions in a metropolitan area, as living in areas such as Seoul is highly desirable. Kang et al. (2019) reported that students at non- metropolitan colleges had the intention to drop out not only in the early phase of their college study but, due to their continuing dissatisfaction, even throughout their sub- sequent years of study. Chung et al. (2015) found that the dropout rate of colleges in the metropolitan area was low, while S. Kim (2006) confirmed that the college location had an effect on male students only. With regard to college characteristics and size, a host of   influential   factors   were   revealed   by   numerous researchers (e.g., Kang et al., 2019; M. Kim, 2021). Such influential factors include college finances, revenue from industry   subsidies,   scholarships,   first-year   enrollment rate,   competition   among   departments   for   freshman admissions, education cost per student, dormitory accep- tance rate, number of students per full-time faculty, and research funding from off-campus resources. College environmental factors have also been shown to influence college discontinuation in other countries as well. In the U.S., recent education statistics have provided evidence of the influence of the type of insti- tution   (2-yearvs.4-year)   on   college   completion:   The dropout rate among students at 2-year colleges has been higher than that among students at 4-year institu- tions, regardless of age, gender, or ethnicity (Hanson, 2021). The availability of financial aid is another factor influencing the dropout rate, as evidenced by Modena et al.’s (2020) finding that without the assistance of need-based grants, approximately one-third of students at universities in Italy would have dropped out in their first year of study.  4   SAGE Open

College Life Factors.   College life factors include college life adjustment level, college life and department satisfac- tion, student support satisfaction, and relationships with others (faculty-student interaction). College life adjust- ment and satisfaction refer to a condition in which a stu- dent is in a harmonious relationship with the college environment, including adaptation to the overall college life including academics and interpersonal relationships (Woo & Noh, 2014). Various previous studies have shown that students with higher college life satisfaction are less likely to drop out (Kang et al., 2019; M. Kim, 2021). Several studies have revealed that students’ satisfac- tion with their major, that is, that it is a good match for their aptitude and career path, and their clear sense of purpose about their college and major have an effect on college   life   satisfaction   and   academic   discontinuation (e.g., Lim, 2020; H. Roh & Choi, 2008). Song and Kim (2019) found that the higher the satisfaction with educa- tional and welfare facilities, the lower the probability of students   dropping   out.   Also,   Kim   and   Lee   (2022) reported that the higher the satisfaction with psychologi- cal counseling and career/job start-up support, the lower the probability of students dropping out. In   addition,   studies   analyzing   how   relationships between students and professors affect college dropouts have shown inconsistent results. In several studies, the interaction between students and professors was con- firmed   as   an   important   variable   explaining   dropout (Choi, 2010; S. Kim, 2010). In the study of Song and Kim (2019), the degree to which a professor gave stu- dents clear vision and self-esteem for their career path was confirmed as an important variable explaining drop- out. However, S. Kim (2008) found that neither friend- ships among students nor meetings with advisors were related to college dropout. Kang et al. (2019) showed that relationships between freshmen and other students tend to influence the dropout rate. College life factors have also been shown to be deter- minants of college discontinuation in the U.S. The results of a University of Texas-Austin survey provided empiri- cal evidence that a supportive college environment with policies and practices providing strong support for stu- dents can result in a lower college dropout rate (Price & Tovar, 2014). College graduation rates have also been linked to students’ connectedness to the institution and to the relationships it fosters, such as those among peers, instructors, and counselors. Also, research has shown that a key factor in increasing college completion is advising   students   on   coping   with   the   problems   they encounter and succeeding in the college environment (Fulcrum Labs, 2021). The current study investigates factors affecting aca- demic discontinuation, including personal factors (gen- der,   high   school   type,   college   grades,   psychological stability, parental education, parental income), college environmental factors (type of college, college location), and college life factors (satisfaction with college life, satisfaction with college and department). Based on these three   classifications   of   influential   variables   and   the review of literature presented above, this study aims to examine the determinants of college discontinuation (i.e., dropouts and stopouts) in Korea.  Research Method  This quantitative study examined potentially influential determinants of students’ decisions to drop out or stop out from colleges in South Korea. A regression analysis design was deemed appropriate for this investigation.  Data  In this study, data from the KEEP II survey conducted by   the   Korea   Research   Institute   for   Vocational Education and Training (KRIVET) were used to exam- ine the determinants of college dropouts and stopouts. As a global research institute, KRIVET aims to achieve dramatic improvement in the area of national human resource development. The KEEP II data are collected annually to continuously investigate   and analyze   the educational experience of young people and the transi- tion process to the job market, and to build a database that is sustainable and representative in the long term. This study analyzed data collected during the years 2016 to 2019. In 2016, data were collected at 2,167 high schools from students in their second year (comparable to the 11th grade in the U.S.). The high schools included 1,595 gen- eral high schools; 428 specialized high schools (voca- tional education, alternative schools); and 144 special purpose high schools (foreign language high schools, sci- ence high schools, arts high schools, etc.). The KEEP II used a proportional stratification sampling method that stratified the country by region and extracted classes and students from selected schools. Data have been collected from approximately 6,125 high school students every year since 2016, with follow-up investigations conducted in subsequent years.  Variables  In this study, college discontinuation was conceptualized as   two   dependent   variables:   dropouts   and   stopouts. Dropouts refer to college students who discontinue their studies and do not graduate, while stopouts refer to those who discontinue their studies only for a certain period of time before graduating.

This study’s significance is that its research design aims to help fill the gap in the literature on academic dis- continuation   among   college   students   in   Korea. Specifically, this study distinguished between cases of dropout and stopout, rather than treating them as a sin- gle academic interruption. Furthermore, the study cate- gorized the factors influencing dropout and stopout into three dimensions—personal, college environmental, and college life factors—and then comprehensively examined those factors. This study is not without limitations. First, as this study was limited to the examination of factors influen- cing college discontinuation in South Korea, caution is advised regarding generalization of the results. Despite the contributions of this focused research, future studies providing a comparison of analysis of data from other countries could be beneficial not only for the generaliza- tion of results but also for the identification of other potentially influential factors.

were treated as dummy variables (dropouts = 1, other- wise = 0; and stopouts = 1, otherwise = 0). In the process of selecting the independent variables, a review of previous studies revealed a number of factors that could have an impact on students’ college disconti- nuation (dropouts and stopouts). Finally, from a review of the available data provided by the KEEP II survey, 13 variables were selected. Specifically, the independent variables were grouped into three categories. The first category included per- sonal   characteristics:   gender   (male = 1,   female = 0), father’s educational background, mother’s educational background, parental income, college grades (GPA/full marks), general high school graduation (normal high school = 1, otherwise = 0); and psychological stability. The second category consisted of college environmental factors   including   college   location   (Seoul   and Gyeonggi = 1, otherwise = 0), whether or not enrolled in a 2-year college (2-year college = 1, otherwise = 0), and whether or not enrolled in a 4-year college (4-year college = 1, otherwise = 0). The third category consisted of college life factors including satisfaction with college life, with the department, and with the college itself. The definition, description, and measurement of each vari- able are presented in Table 1.  Conceptual Model and Statistical Model  As illustrated in the conceptual model below (Figure 1), the independent variables are largely divided into personal factors, college environmental factors, and college life fac- tors. Two types of college discontinuation—dropouts and stopouts—are set as the dependent variables. As binary logistic regression is the appropriate analy- sis when the dependent variable is dichotomous (binary), this method of predictive analysis was selected to explain the relationships between college discontinuation (drop- outs   and   stopouts)   and   the   independent   variables described in Table 1. Binary logistic regression was performed to assess the impact of the independent variables on the likelihood that subjects would fall into the category of college disconti- nuation, either as dropouts or stopouts. In Equation 1, below, the dependent variables are dropout and stopout, and the predictors are the 13 independent variables.  In   p  1      p   =   b 0   +   b 1 x 1   +   b 2 x 2   +   b 3 x 3   +   b x 4   +   b 5 x 5  +   b 6 x 6   +   b 7 x 7   +   b 8 x 8   +   b 9 x 9   +   b 10 x 10  +   b 11 x 11   +   b 12 x 12   +   b 13 x 13   +   e i  ð 1 Þ  Where   p   is the event probability (dropouts or stopouts);  b 0   is the   Y -intercept;   b 1   to   b 13   = the coefficients (or slopes) of the 13 predictor variables;   x 1   to   x 13   = indepen- dent variables where   x 1   = gender,   x 2   = father’s educa- tion,   x 3   = mother’s   education,   x 4   = parents’   income,  x 5   = college grades,   x 6   = general high school,   x 7   = psy- chological   stability,   x 8   = college   location,   x 9   = 2-year college,   x 10   = 4-year college,   x 11   = satisfaction with col- lege life,   x 12   = satisfaction with department,   x 13   = satis- faction with college.   b 0   to   b 13   are estimated by the maximum likelihood estimator MLE approach.   e i   = the error term that captures errors in measurement of   Y   and the effect on   Y   of any variables missing from the equa- tion that would contribute to explaining variations in   Y .  Results  Descriptive Statistical Analysis  Table 2 presents the descriptive statistical analysis results for the 13 independent variables covered in this study. Regarding the dependent variables, dropout and stopout, it was found that among the 8,485 students surveyed, 1.2% dropped out of college while 5.3% stopped out of college. Of the total respondents, 50.6% were male. The father’s educational background was 4.952 on average, while the mother’s educational background was 4.723, indicating that parents, on average, had at least a high school education. The average parental monthly income was 0.012, indicating a monthly salary of 212,2000 won, or US$ 1670.71. Regarding college grades, the average score was 74.8 out of a score of 100. Of the total respondents, 54.6% of students   graduated   from   a   general   high   school. Psychological stability was found to be an average of 2.205, with 1 being unstable psychological stability and 5 being psychological stability. Most of the college respon- dents showed good psychological stability. With regard to college environmental factors, 25.6% of the students were attending colleges located in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province, with 12.6% attending a 2-year college and 42.2% attending a 4-year college. Lastly, looking at college   life   factors,   school   life   satisfaction   was   3.614, department satisfaction was 3.730, and college satisfaction was 3.620, all indicating moderate satisfaction.  Determinants Affecting College Dropouts  Table 3 presents the results of the binary logistic regres- sion analysis of the factors affecting the dropout of col- lege students. Model 1 includes only personal factors, and Model 2 includes personal factors and college envi- ronmental factors. In the analysis of Model 3, which includes all independent variables, first, for personal factors, college grades showed a statistically significant negative influence, indicating that the lower the college grades, the more likely students will drop out ( 2 2.196,  6   SAGE Open

p   \   .05). Psychological stability was found to have a sta- tistically   significant   and   negative   effect   ( 2 0.627,   p  \   .05), indicating that the more psychologically stable students have a tendency to drop out. Second, none of the college environmental factors had a statistically sig- nificant influence. Third, with respect to college life fac- tors, college satisfaction was found to have a statistically significant   negative   influence   ( 2 0.965,   p   \   .001). Therefore, it can be said that students who are less satis- fied with the college they attend are more likely to drop out.

factors, gender was found to be statistically significant and to have a positive ( + ) relationship with college students’ stopouts (1.480,   p   \   .001). This indicates that male students have a greater tendency to stop out. Parental income was found to have a statistically sig- nificant but weak influence (5.384,   p   \   .100), indicating that students with higher parental income are more likely to stop out from college. College grades were also found to have a negative ( 2 ) relationship with stopouts ( 2 0.1911,   p   \   .001). In other words, students with lower grades tend to stop out. Second, with respect to the college environmental fac- tors, the location of the college was found to have a sta- tistically   negative   relationship   ( 2 0.020,   p   \   .05)   with stopouts, but it was found that the students in colleges outside the Seoul and Gyeonggi-do areas have a greater tendency to stop out. In addition, the 2-year college vari- able showed a statistically significant but weak influence (0.399,   p   \   .100), indicating that students attending 2- year colleges tend to stop out. Lastly, for college life fac- tors, department satisfaction ( 2 0.239,   p   \   .05) and col- lege satisfaction ( 2 0.273,   p   \   .01) showed statistically significant results. These results indicate that students with lower department satisfaction or lower college satis- faction tend to stop out.  Discussion and Conclusion  This study empirically analyzed the determinants of col- lege   students’   academic   discontinuation   (dropout   or stopout)   using   data   from   the   Korea   Education   and Employment Panel II survey. To this end, the indepen- dent variables were classified into three categories: per- sonal factors, college environmental factors, and college life factors. These factors affecting college dropouts and stopouts were analyzed using binary logistic regression analysis. Based on the analysis results, the main factors affect- ing the dropout of college students are as follows. First, in terms of personal factors, a negative relationship with college grades indicates that students with lower college grades tend to drop out. These results are consistent with previous studies showing that low college grades and academic difficulties have an effect on academic dropout (Joung, 2020; Lim, 2020). These findings point to the need for policies that provide academic support for stu- dents with low grades and at risk of dropping out. Additionally,   multifaceted   support   is   required   at   the department   level   (e.g.,   counseling   and   mentoring   of seniors); at the teaching and learning support center level (e.g., consulting and guidance on learning methods, and learning programs and clubs); and at the non-curricular support center level (e.g., classes related to developing basic learning skills). To implement these various forms of assistance, colleges require the support of effective policies and adequate funding from the government. Furthermore, the negative relationship between psy- chological stability and dropout indicates that psycholo- gically stable students tend to drop out.
