ABSTRACT Objective   The attrition of medical students is an incredibly important problem feeding into healthcare workforce issues. This study seeks to explore the relationships between various mental health issues and dropout.  Design   This is a longitudinal study where medical students completed an online questionnaire between November 2020 and February 2021 and those who took part were invited (February–May 2021) to complete the questionnaire again 3   months later.  Settings   Students from nine geographically spread medical schools in the UK took part in this study.  Participants   792 (71.16%) participants filled in the baseline questionnaire and 407 (51.39%) of these students completed the follow- up survey (385 participants were lost to follow- up).  Outcome measures   Dropout intentions.  Exposures   Various mental ill- health symptoms using validated scales: emotional exhaustion, insomnia, somatisation, hazardous drinking, anxiety/depression, anorexia tendencies, obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD), paranoia and bipolar.  Results   A large number of students met the criteria for mental health disorders (eg, 54.1% insomnia, 37.9% anxiety/depression, 19.4% paranoia) and 19.4% (79) said that they considered dropping out from medical school. Those students who were more emotionally exhausted (B adjusted =0.94, p<0.0001) and expressed higher anxiety/ depression symptoms (B   adjusted =1.12, p<0.0001), insomnia symptoms (B adjusted =0.69, p<0.0001), somatisation symptoms (B   adjusted =0.77, p<0.0001), anorexia tendencies (B   adjusted =−0.84, p<0.0001), OCD symptoms (B adjusted =0.61, p<0.0001) and paranoia symptoms (B adjusted =0.52, p<0.0001) expressed significantly stronger intentions to leave their medical education. Hazardous drinking and bipolar symptoms did not predict students’ intention to drop out (p>0.05).  Conclusions   A substantial number of UK medical students experienced mental ill- health symptoms, about one in five medical students considers leaving medical school, and mental ill- health symptoms contributed to students’ intentions to leave their medical education. Medical schools should improve the learning environment for students and encourage them to seek help to reduce the stigma of mental ill- health symptoms (eg, through education, signposting). It may be useful for medical schools to help applicants/medical students understand whether medical school is the right decision for them and provide them with resources should they wish to leave.  INTRODUCTION  The ever- increasing doctor shortages are a huge cause for concern, with the current shortfall reported as being over 6.4   million doctors worldwide.   1 2   A recent survey of The National Health Service (NHS) in the UK, which has experienced a chronic shortage of doctors over the past decade, reported that 4 in 10 junior doctors wanted to leave the NHS as soon as possible.   3   Doctor shortages have an undeniable impact on healthcare systems— resulting in increased workload, decreased doctors’ well- being and a lower quality of care.   4   These environments of chronic stress and   decreased   morale   that   occur   due   to doctors being unable to provide optimal care for patients, in turn, increase pressure on existing staff, resulting in them leaving the NHS and further contributing to staff short- ages.   5–7   In other words: the continuous short- fall of doctors and increase in vacancies have created a vicious cycle within the workplace. A complete resolution of the staffing crisis has been deemed to be unlikely for the near future, due to the health and social care sector facing the most acute recruitment and retention crisis in its history.   8   To combat this workforce   crisis,   medical   students—as   our future doctors—play a pivotal role. Medical  STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY  ⇒   A strength of this study is the elaborate data col- lection approach, which used inclusive recruitment materials both spoken and written and disseminat- ed across various platforms.  ⇒   The geographical and demographic spread repre- sented in the sample is more likely to contribute to the generalisability of results.  ⇒   The limitation of this survey study is the inability to calculate a response rate due to the recruitment strategy.  ⇒   The work relies on self- reported data by students.

BMJ Open   2025; 15 :e094058. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2024-094058  Open access  students’ attrition rates are reported to vary from 3.8% to 26% in different countries, such as the UK, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Nigeria.   9   Attrition of medical students is therefore an incredibly important problem feeding into healthcare workforce issues. To be better able to address the worldwide doctor shortages, we must understand the reasons why certain students are more likely to leave their medical training, so that we may retain these valuable individuals and prevent future students from dropping out. There   are   many   similarities   between   doctors   and medical   students,   specifically   their   work   environ- ments; both populations are subjected to high levels of competition, insufficient support systems and isola- tion. 10   11   Evidence-  based   theoretical   occupational health psychology models such as the job demands and resources (JD- R) model demonstrate how such a stressful work environment that is high in demands and scarce in resources can trigger stress reactions and hamper motiva- tion and productivity.   12   Thus, the work environment of an individual has a strong impact on their well- being.   13   How this affects mental health may be challenging to quantify, with the literature reporting 20–78% of medical students worldwide   have   been   reported   to   be   suffering   from mental health issues. 14–18   Despite it being evidenced that medical students are highly likely to face mental health issues and burnout, little research has been conducted into the influence this has on students’ dropout rates. In addition, although the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders   19   emphasises that mental health issues are often accompanied by functional impairment, including academic, and so the assumption that mental health issues impact students’ dropout intentions seems to follow logically from that knowledge, concrete scien- tific proof of this relationship for our study context is missing. Student attrition might have a significant impact on an overall already overstretched healthcare work- force, and thus, a better understanding of what aspects contribute   to   this   problem   is   needed.   We   therefore believe it is of great value to researchers and practitioners to explore the relationship between mental health and academic outcomes in medical education and training. It is also particularly uncertain which specific mental health issues have a larger influence on students dropping out of medical school. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the relationships between various mental health issues and dropout intentions. This can help us ascertain which medical students need to be prioritised for mental health support with the aim of preventing them from dropping out of medical school.  METHODS Study setting  This study is part of a larger research project funded by the British Medical Association consisting of a survey, documentary analysis and interviews.   16 20 21   The current study will focus on the data obtained through the survey. The   reporting   follows   Strengthening   the   Reporting of   Observational   Studies   in   Epidemiology   reporting guidelines.  Data collection  For this study, we selected nine geographically spread medical   schools   from   England,   Scotland,   Wales   and Northern Ireland varying in size and type of curriculum (integrated combining preclinical and clinical study years vs non- integrated separating preclinical and clinical study years). Students from all study years were invited to fill in a web- based survey (platform:   Online surveys ) between November 2020 and February 2021 and those who took part were invited (February–May 2021) to complete the questionnaire again 3   months later. The 3- month mark for the follow- up was made based on the medical students’ education   schedules   avoiding   any   substantial   curric- ulum changes (eg, moves between university years) and examination periods. This was done to avoid any peaks of stress that would potentially have impacted students’ responses. Recruitment material was distributed through various channels by medical school staff (eg, newsletter or lecture announcement). As recruitment strategies varied per school depending on their policies and preferences, it was not possible to calculate response rates. Of the 1113 medical students who consented to take part in the study, 310 did not fill in the questionnaire and another 11 were ineligible (9 duplicates, 1 from an unparticipating university and 1 missing more than 50% of answers). 792 (71.16%) participants filled in the baseline question- naire and 407 (51.39%) of these students completed the follow- up survey (385 participants were lost to follow- up). There were no substantial differences between those who completed the follow- up survey (407) and those who did not (385) (see the study authored by Medisauskaite   et al 16 ).  Patient and public involvement statement  The survey was piloted with five medical student volun- teers who filled in the survey and provided us with their feedback. After amendments, the survey was discussed with advisory group members which consisted of medical students, doctors, other academics, researchers and prac- titioners working at organisations responsible for medical education provision and student support. The survey was then finalised based on their feedback.  Questionnaire  The survey included previously validated questionnaires where possible. The survey consisted of demographic variables that were considered empirically or theoretically relevant to the study, a dropout measure asking medical students about their intention to drop out in the recent past (ie, the past month), and mental ill- health measures (see table   1 for a detailed description of the operational- isation of these measures). Identical questionnaires were collected at both time points.

Participants were allowed to miss up to one- third of the data for each scale and mean scores were computed over the remaining items. All scales were approximately normally distributed (skew- ness and kurtosis between −2 and 2; no extreme outliers). Internal consistency (Cronbach’s   α ) was deemed suffi- cient (>0.7). Exploratory statistics were performed to gain insight into associations between main constructs (see online supplemental appendix 1 for results). Longitudinal data were used to investigate what mental ill- health   symptoms   were   associated   with   students’ dropout   intentions.   Unadjusted   and   adjusted   gener- alised   estimating   equations   (GEEs)   were   performed to   investigate   what   mental   ill- health   symptoms   were associated with students’ dropout intentions. Adjusted models included six out of nine measured demographic characteristics (table 4 and table 5); three variables were not included due to multicollinearity or lack of variation in data. GEEs were considered appropriate for handling the longitudinal data as they allowed us to include data from both time points and specify depen- dency between the data from similar subjects. The best fit for the covariance matrix for each analysis was deter- mined by comparing the Fisher scoring of an unstruc- tured covariance matrix to the simpler independent matrix. Missing data were automatically removed from the analysis (<5%). Power calculations for GEE models are less accurate than traditional power calculations. Our sample size of 407 participants exceeds the rules of thumb for GEE; we have >20 subjects (clusters) in our study. P values <0.05, <0.01 and <0.001 for two- sided tests were calculated and reported, as were the regres- sion coefficient and the 95% CI.

BMJ Open   2025; 15 :e094058. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2024-094058  Open access  UK and Ireland consume similar amounts of alcohol as our study population. 26   However, the pressures from medical   school   and   students’   learning   environments may exacerbate mental ill- health symptoms. 16   Research shows that the high prevalence of mental ill- health also applies to nursing students. Meta- analyses of nursing students globally show that they also have similarly high levels of emotional exhaustion (41.1%) 27   and depression (34%).   28   Nursing and medical students share similarities in studying a healthcare curriculum. For instance, they may encounter stressful interactions with patients and other clinicians and responsibilities in clinical work which they feel unprepared for. A further similarity is that both medical students and student nurses report unwillingness to seek help for their own mental health because of fears of stigma and confidentiality. 20 29   This may act as a consid- erable barrier to seeking help for both groups and may be partly responsible for the high levels of mental ill- health. This current study additionally revealed that 19.4% of medical students considered dropping out of medical school. This is a higher number than actual medical student attrition, which has been estimated to be around 5%. 30   However, following the principles of the Theory of Planned Behaviour, we know that intentions are proxy to action 31   and considering the recent challenges of the pandemic and the difficulties after, the percentage of actual attrition might potentially have increased. Further- more,   the   fact   that   students   are   considering   leaving medical school is a sign that students may be unhappy during their education, even when staying in medical school. Students who complete medical school while doubting about their career trajectory may be more inclined to drop out of postgraduate training. This feeds into an already existing problem of attrition in post- graduate training: the number of doctors who pause their training after completing Foundation training has doubled from 34% in 2011/2012 to 70% in 2020/2021. 23 From   this   cohort   of   students   pausing   training,   it   is thought that 12% will not return to practice. 23   This is not only problematic for healthcare systems, but also for the medical students themselves. Dropping out of medical school   can   have   significant   personal,   financial   and psychological consequences for the individual. There is also the financial cost to the taxpayer, and the time and effort wasted by educators. 32 To combat the loss of trainees and support the work- force in the future, the NHS Long Term Plan ambitiously sets out to double the number of medical school training  Table 4   Association between intentions to drop out and emotional exhaustion, anxiety/depression, insomnia, somatisation symptoms and hazardous drinking (controlling for socio- demographic characteristics) Emotional exhaustion (B (95% Wald CI), p-  value) 0.94 (0.68 to 1.21), p=0.000*** sg  Anxiety/depression symptoms   1.12 (0.84 to 1.39), p=0.000***   sg Insomnia symptoms   0.69 (0.43 to 0.94), p=0.000***   sg Somatisation symptoms   0.77 (0.48 to 1.06), p=0.000*** sg Hazardous drinking (yes)   −0.36 (−0.81 to 0.10), p=0.123 Gender (female)   0.06 (−0.54 to 0.65), p=0.847 0.11 (−0.46 to 0.68), p=0.703 −0.08 (−0.60 to 0.45), p=0.780 0.14 (−0.42 to 0.69), p=0.628 −0.19 (−0.71 to 0.34), p=0.480 Ethnicity (BME)   0.50 (−0.02 to 1.02), p=0.059 0.49 (−0.01 to 0.99), p=0.057 0.53 (−0.03 to 1.03), p=0.036* 0.42 (−0.08 to 0.92), 0.097 0.31 (−0.18 to 0.80), p=0.208 Sexual orientation (LGBTQ)   0.17 (−0.42 to 0.76), p=0.575 0.25 (−0.35 to 0.85), p=0.416 0.25 (−0.36 to 0.86), p=0.416 0.23 (−0.36 to 0.81), p=0.447 0.03 (−0.54 to 0.61), p=0.910 Relationship status (married/co-  habiting/civil partnership) −0.53 (−1.11 to 0.05), p=0.072 −0.44 (−1.15 to 0.26), p=0.217 −0.72 (−1.33 to −0.11), p=0.021* −0.72 (−1.36 to −0.09), p=0.026* −0.74 (−1.34 to −0.15), p=0.014* Widening participation (no)   0.51 (−0.10 to 1.12), p=0.102 0.52 (−0.11 to 1.15), p=0.106 0.59 (0 to 1.17) p=0.049* 0.58 (−0.03 to 1.18), p=0.060 0.72 (0.13 to 1.32), p=0.017* Medical school year   −0.25 (−0.39 to −0.12), p=0.000***   sg −0.18 (−0.33 to −0.03), p=0.016* −0.17 (−0.30 to −0.04), p=0.012* −0.13 (−0.27 to 0), p=0.053 −0.16 (−0.30 to −0.03), p=0.020* Dropout   ref   group 0=no; ***p<0.0001; **p<0.001; *p<0.05; Bonferroni correction indicates   sg   (nine tests, p value with Bonferroni correction equals 0.006).

BMJ Open   2025; 15 :e094058. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2024-094058  Open access  spots, with the intention of achieving 15   000 places in 2031/2032. 22   Furthermore,   plans   are   to   shorten   the curriculum from the current 5 and 6   years to 4 years and to introduce medical school apprenticeships, with a focus on attracting those from under- represented backgrounds. These measures may seem promising at first glance, but the workload of medical students is already concerning in the current 5- year and 6- year curricula, 20   so adding pressure by shortening training may lead to increased dropout rates. This reasoning can be further supported not only by our study results, but also by occupational health psychology theories. Our study linked mental ill- health to increased intentions to drop out and specifically those students who were emotionally exhausted and had anxiety/depression symptoms, insomnia, somatisation symptoms, anorexia tendencies, obsessive- compulsive or paranoia symptoms were more likely to consider dropping out from medical school. Using occupational health psychology theories such as the JD- R model can help to better understand the results of this study. According to the JD- R model, the higher the job demands and the lower the resources in a work environment, the more likely the occurrence of stress and a lack of work engagement and general well-  being.   33   In turn, this can impact employees’ productivity and potentially their decision to stay in or leave their workplace. 34 35   Although this model is rarely used in the medical undergraduate setting, 36   similarly to the work- place students’ learning environment brings on demands and resources that can impact students’ well- being. From a JD- R model perspective, increasing demands such as the proposed curriculum change without offering sufficient resources to handle these demands can be detrimental to medical students. The approach taken in this study—exploring a variety of   specific   mental   ill- health   symptoms—is   novel   and differs from studies linking more generic mental health indicators to dropout, such as a recent longitudinal study of Thai medical students. 37   The authors collected medical students’ self- reported mental health screening data on admission and found a significant association between students’   mental   health   and   dropout.   Our   specific approach allows for differentiation between the various mental health conditions, bringing insight into which student groups might most benefit from support. Those mental ill- health issues not related to dropout, such as hazardous drinking and experiencing bipolar symptoms, might require a different approach or policy when trying to reduce attrition in medical school.  Implications  The findings of this study suggest that medical students’ mental health is an important contributor to students dropping out and reinforces the importance of supporting students   at   medical   school.   Mental   health   symptoms can be difficult to pinpoint, like emotional exhaustion, somatisation symptoms and insomnia, due to students actively trying to conceal their problems. To combat this, regular well- being checks can be implemented through meetings with personal tutors. The various mental health symptoms that have been found to predict dropout are particularly difficult to recognise in medical students, due to the ‘toxic’ and competitive work culture of medical school normalising the idea of individuals experiencing  Table 5   Association between intentions to drop out and anorexic tendencies, obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD), paranoia and bipolar symptoms (controlling for socio- demographic characteristics) Anorexic tendencies (yes) (B (95% Wald CI), p- value) −0.84 (−1.29 to −0.38), p=0.000*** sg OCD symptoms   0.61 (0.44 to 0.79), 0.000*** s g  Paranoia symptoms   0.52 (0.31 to 0.73), p=0.000*** sg Bipolar symptoms   0.51 (−0.27 to 1.28), p=0.199 Gender (female)   0.14 (−0.41 to 0.69), p=0.618   0.10 (−0.43 to 0.64), p=0.708 −0.08 (−0.61 to 0.45), p=0.768 0.14 (−0.66 to 0.39), p=0.608 Ethnicity (BME)   0.47 (−0.01 to 0.95), p=0.055   0.66 (0.17 to 1.16), p=0.009** 0.45 (−0.03 to 0.92), p=0.067 0.46 (−0.03 to 0.94), p=0.064 Sexual orientation (LGBTQ)   0.15 (−0.44 to 0.74), p=0.614   0.13 (−0.48 to 0.74), p=0.675 0.15 (−0.43 to 0.73), p=0.614 0.09 (−0.49 to 0.66), p=0.764 Relationship status (married/co-  habiting/civil partnership) −0.72 (−1.34 to −0.10), p=0.022* −0.67 (−1.32 to −0.02), p=0.042* -0.71 (- 1.35 to -0.07), p=0.030* −0.69 (−1.29 to −0.09), p=0.025* Widening participation (No)   0.74 (0.15 to 1.33), p=0.014*   0.57 (−0.01 to 1.14), p=0.054 0.61 (0.02 to 1.20) p=0.043* 0.69 (0.10 to 1.28), p=0.022* Medical school year   −0.16 (−0.29 to −0.02), p=0.022* −0.17 (−0.31 to −0.03), p=0.014* −0.14 (−0.28 to −0.01), p=0.040* −0.15 (−0.28 to −0.01), p=0.036* Dropout   ref   group 0=no; ***p<0.0001; **p<0.001; *p<0.05; Bonferroni correction indicates   sg   (nine tests, p value with Bonferroni correction equals 0.006).

We know the context in which medical students learn   impacts   their   well- being.   16   20   Medical   schools should improve the learning environment for students and encourage them to seek help to reduce the stigma of mental health symptoms. This can be through educating students on warning signs of mental decline through workshops   or   courses,   and   signposting   clearly   where they can go for help. Medical schools should also actively clarify that seeking help will not jeopardise their careers, but rather improve their chances of completing their degree. There should be no discrimination against indi- viduals with these diagnoses, as with appropriate interven- tions and more supportive learning environments many students can flourish. While medical schools can take action to improve their environment, it is important to acknowledge that medical school is not for everyone and to provide resources for those medical students who are deciding whether to continue and those who choose to leave. It may be useful for medical schools to have systems in place that can help new applicants (and existing medical students) consider whether medical training is for them by setting realistic expectations of the demands of medical training.  Strengths and limitations  The sample in this study may be skewed as students with mental health issues may be keener to respond. Although the researchers tried their best to work with medical schools to guarantee a representative sample, due to the role of medical schools in the recruitment process the researchers were unable to fully control the recruitment strategy. A strength of the study is the elaborate data collection approach, which used inclusive recruitment materials both spoken and written (eg, newsletter or lecture announcement) and disseminated across various platforms. Furthermore, the geographical and demo- graphic spread represented in the sample is more likely to contribute to the generalisability of results. The various mental health conditions represented in this study bring new insights into the existing discourse of similar work in this field. However, some of the condi- tions, such as experiencing bipolar symptoms, were only prevalent for a small subset of the sample. This means that analysis conducted for these conditions was less reli- able. In addition, despite bipolar symptoms potentially affecting students’ time at university, they might not deliberately leave medical school because of their mental state (grandiose ideation) due to this condition. This may explain why we did not find any significant links for those experiencing bipolar symptoms. We did not measure the action of dropping out but measured intentions with one item. However, we believe that the findings are valuable as (1) intentions are a proxy of action and (2) findings provide insight into various signs of dropout intentions, including students contemplating leaving as well as students having serious considerations of leaving. This is a strength as it allows us to understand what factors contribute to students’ intentions to leave medical school and plan for early interventions to help retain these students. Furthermore, the work relies on self- reported data by students. Considering the sensitive nature of the research, this may mean that students under- reported their mental ill- health symptoms. In terms of the dropout measure, we were only able to ask about students’ intentions. We consider this relevant as even having the intention to leave medical school is an important measure in itself and an indication that students are unhappy. However, for future research, it is key to consider actual dropout statistics to get a better sense of the true scale of the problem. We also acknowledge that the relationships between different mental ill- health issues and students’ personal/ medical school circumstances are complex and might have an impact on their dropout intentions. Psychiatric symptoms also can co- occur. This study did not aim to investigate the path looking at how different diagnoses relate to each other but rather focuses on investigating symptoms and their link to such medical school outcomes such as dropout. We encourage future researchers to investigate this topic in more depth, using quantitative and qualitative methods.

RESULTS Participants  Please   refer   to   table   2   for   more   details   on   study characteristics. 19.4% (79) of medical students said that they consid- ered dropping out of medical school. Table   3 presents the prevalence of students meeting screening criteria for mental ill- health in our sample. Over 1 in 2 students were   drinking   hazardously   (60.2%),   experienced insomnia symptoms (clinical or subthreshold; 54.1%) and somatisation symptoms (medium–very high; 52.1%), and   had   obsessive- compulsive   disorder   (OCD)   symp- toms (51.8%). Nearly half of our participants expressed having anorexia tendencies (44.7%). Approximately 1 in 3 students were emotionally exhausted (36.1%) and had anxiety/depression symptoms (37.9%). 19.4% of students had paranoia symptoms and 2.9% had bipolar symptoms.  Predicting students’ intentions to drop out  All   mental   ill- health   symptoms   predicted   medical students’   dropout   intentions   except   for   hazardous drinking   and   bipolar   symptoms   (see   table   4   and table   5). Those students who were more emotionally exhausted (B adjusted =0.94, 95%   CI: 0.68 to 1.21, p<0.0001) and   expressed   higher   anxiety/depression   symptoms (B adjusted =1.12, 95%   CI: 0.84 to 1.39, p<0.0001), insomnia symptoms (B   adjusted =0.69, 95%   CI: 0.43 to 0.94, p<0.0001), somatisation symptoms (B adjusted =0.77, 95%   CI: 0.48 to 1.06, p<0.0001), anorexia tendencies (B adjusted =−0.84, 95%   CI: −1.29 to −0.38, p<0.0001), OCD symptoms (B adjusted =0.61, 95%   CI:   0.44   to   0.79,   p<0.0001),   paranoia   symptoms (B   adjusted =0.52, 95%   CI: 0.31 to 0.73, p<0.0001), expressed significantly stronger intentions to leave their medical education. Hazardous drinking and bipolar symptoms did not predict students’ intention to drop out (p>0.05).  DISCUSSION  The pressure on health services is bound to increase in the future: considering the ageing population, the NHS Long Term Plan foresees a healthcare shortage of 260   000–360   000 staff by 2036/2037. 22   Dropout across the medical training pathway, alongside practising health- care professionals leaving the NHS early in their careers, is contributing to the staffing concerns and service pres- sures. 23   To better understand why medical students are dropping out of medical school, this study aimed to explore to what extent mental ill- health symptoms lead to medical student attrition intentions. The study revealed that a substantial number of UK medical students expe- rienced mental ill- health symptoms, about one in five medical   students   considered   leaving   medical   school, and mental ill- health symptoms contributed to students’ intentions to leave their medical education. The prevalence for each of the mental health conditions varied in our sample, but results showed that a substantial number of medical students met screening criteria for mental ill- health. Over half of the students were drinking hazardously (60.2%) and experienced insomnia (54.1%), somatisation (52.3%) or OCD symptoms (51.8%). Over one in three students was experiencing anorexia tenden- cies, emotional exhaustion or depressive/anxiety symp- toms. These results may partly be attributed to the study demographic; medical students are young adults that face significant life challenges and often prioritise socialising over healthy life choices. 24 25   Drinking and staying up late are therefore behaviours often seen among students. In fact, studies show that undergraduate students in the  Table 2   Study characteristics  Variables 407 participants N (%) or M (SD)  Gender (female)   305 (74.9)  Missing   3 (0.7) Age   21.49 (3.24) Ethnicity (white)   263 (64.6)  Missing   5 (1.2) Sexuality (heterosexual)   311 (76.4)  Missing   13 (3.2) Relationship status (single/never married) 362 (88.9) Widening participation student (yes)*   62 (15.2) Parents/guardians/carers occupation (higher managerial) 324 (79.6) University year  First   121 (29.7)  Second   74 (18.2)  Third   58 (14.3)  Fourth   75 (18.4)  Fifth   56 (13.8)  Sixth   22 (5.4)  Missing   1 (0.2) University (UNI)  UNI1   38 (9.3)  UNI2   3 (0.7)  UNI3   127 (31.2)  UNI4   92 (22.6)  UNI5   30 (7.4)  UNI6   16 (3.9)  UNI7   39 (9.6)  UNI8   28 (6.9)  UNI9   34 (8.4) *Widening participants is a scheme that aims to support and encourage students from under- represented backgrounds to study in higher education.
