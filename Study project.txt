1.	Project Summary 
The Emotional Pedagogical Agent (EPA) aims to revolutionize digital learning by offering emotionally aware interactions. The purpose of the EPA project is to enhance the interaction between educators and learners by developing an Emotional Pedagogical Agent that integrates AI features into e-learning environments. The EPA aims to provide a highly responsive, adaptive, and engaging educational experience using machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and affective computing. In this project, assumptions are made that the project will leverage advanced AI technology towards better learners’ outcome. It also assumes that chosen e-learning platform ORTUS supports easy integration. In this project development and deployment assumption is made that the target audience has the necessary equipment and platform access. There should not be major changes to education regulations during the project. If any of these assumptions change, these changes should be addressed to Project Manager.

1.2.	Project Deliverables
1. Project charter: PDF, delivery by April 22, 2025. A Project charter is a key foundational document that formally authorizes a project, defines its objectives, scope, stakeholders, and major constraints, and assigns authority to the project manager. It serves as a reference throughout the project lifecycle and is often the first formal deliverable in project management processes.
2. Requirements specification document: PDF, delivery by April 30, 2025. A requirements specification document, often called Software Requirements Specification (SRS) is a foundational project deliverable that precisely describes the functional and non-functional requirements the system must fulfill. It provides a common understanding for the project team, stakeholders, and future maintainers, forming the basis for design, development, testing, and validation.
3. Design documents and prototypes: PDFs and interactive prototypes, delivery by June 30, 2025. Design documents are comprehensive technical artifacts that specify how the system will be built based on the agreed requirements. They cover the architecture, data models, interfaces, component interactions, and detailed technical specifications. Prototypes are working or interactive models of parts or all of the system, used to visualize, validate, and refine the design with stakeholders before development. In some cases, design refined is done during development.
4. Basic feature development: Source code, delivery by August 31, 2025. Basic feature development refers to initial implementation of the EPA’s core functionalities, transforming design documents, prototypes, and specifications into working software. This stage establishes the minimal viable product (MVP), which demonstrates the agent’s essential capabilities and enables early testing, validation, and feedback.
5. Advanced feature development: Source code, delivery by October 31, 2025. Advanced feature development refers to the implementation of sophisticated, value-added functionalities that go beyond the basic or minimum viable product (MVP) features. These features are designed to maximize the EPA’s educational impact, usability, adaptability, and compliance, and are typically built after the successful completion of basic features and their initial validation.
6. Integration and testing report: PDF, delivery by December 30, 2025. An integration and testing report are a formal document that summarizes the outcomes of the system integration and testing phases of a project. It demonstrates that the developed system components work together as intended, meet the specified requirements, and are ready for deployment. This report is crucial for stakeholders to ensure the software’s reliability, stability, and readiness for production use. 
7. User manuals and training materials: PDFs and video tutorials, delivery by January 31, 2026. User manuals and training materials are comprehensive instructional resources created to help all user groups understand, access, and effectively use the EPA system. These materials ensure that both technical and non-technical users (such as students, educators, and administrators) can benefit from the system with minimal confusion or frustration. For the EPA project this deliverable will be provided electronically, available in both Latvian and English, after the main development and testing phases.
8. Final project report and deployment package: Printed and electronic document, and system deployment package. The final project report is a comprehensive document summarizing the entire project lifecycle, outcomes, challenges, lessons learned, and recommendations. The deployment package is a bundled set of all the technical assets, configuration files, and instructions required to install, configure, and run the EPA system in the target environment (in this case, the ORTUS platform at RTU). These are typically the last deliverables, making the formal closure of the project and the handover to stakeholders, users, or IT support.
1.3.	Project Organization 
Parent organization: Riga Technical University (RTU). This organization is responsible for supervising the project at the highest level. The Project Manager reports to the RTU project oversight committee, providing regular status updates and progress reports. RTU ensures that the project aligns with institutional goals, standards, and any regulatory or strategic requirements. RTU, as the parent organization, likely provides infrastructure (such as access to the ORTUS platform), administrative support, and possibly funding or guidance. 
Acquiring organization: Ministry of Education and Science of Latvia. This organization acts as the project’s principal client or sponsor and communicates regularly with the Project Manager. Ministry of Education and Science of Latvia participates in milestone reviews and project evaluation, and they are actively involved in assessing progress at key stages and in the acceptance of deliverables. This organization may provide strategic direction, feedback, or requirements to ensure the project outcomes align with national educational policies and goals.
Project management Scrum framework, Agile methodology with iterative development and stakeholder feedback. The project follows an Agile development methodology, specifically the Scrum framework. Agile is chosen to allow for iterative development, meaning the project is developed in small, manageable increments called sprints, rather than as a single monolithic effort. Scrum prescribes roles like Scrum Master, Product Owner, events (sprints, reviews), and artifacts (backlog, increments) to organize work and maximize flexibility. Stakeholder feedback is necessary for regular interactions and feedback loops with stakeholders (educators, students, RTU and Ministry of Education and Science of Latvia) are emphasized. Stakeholder feedback is collected at the end of each sprint or major milestone and used to update requirements, refine features, and improve user experience. This ensures the EPA project remains aligned with user needs and institutional goals throughout development. 
Team structure: Project Manager, Requirement Team, Development Team, QA Team and Documentation Team. The team structure is designed for clarity, agility, and efficiency. Defined by functional teams: Requirement, Development, QA and Documentation, and Project Manager who is part of all these teams. These teams are supported by a clear reporting structure and cross-team collaboration. Roles in these teams are aligned with Agile/Scrum best practices, with flexibility for scaling and specialist input as needed.

1.7.	Project Control
1. Budget control: The team conducts bi-weekly (every two weeks) financial reviews to ensure that spending stays within the fixed total project budget of 50,000 euros. These reviews involve checking actual expenses against planned allocations for each work package and category. The project uses a budget tracking tool Monday.com to monitor spending in real time.
2. Schedule control: The project team conducts weekly progress checks to ensure that all milestones and tasks are on track according to the schedule. Tasks and milestones are tracked using Gantt chart in project management tool Monday.com. Any delays are addressed proactively by reallocating resources or adjusting non-critical tasks to minimize impact on the overall timeline. The schedule includes a 10% buffer to accommodate unforeseen delays. 
3. Quality control: All major deliverables, such as code, AI models, and system architecture, undergo peer review. Reviews are done by team members and are not directly involved in the development of the reviewed components. Automated testing is implemented for the AI agent’s functionality, including integration with e-learning platforms. Manual reviews and inspections complement automated tests to ensure thorough coverage. Quality control aims to catch defects, ensure adherence to standards, and improve deliverable quality. 
4. Reporting: The Project Manager prepares monthly progress reports that summarize budget usage, task and milestone completion, identified risks, feedback received from users and stakeholders. This report is shared with all project stakeholders, and it ensures transparency by keeping all parties informed. Stakeholder meetings are scheduled every two months. Change control procedures require that all changes to requirements are documented and reported. All updates and reports are maintained with a control log, which includes version number, description of changes, author and date of change.

Only tools from this list can be used for this project to ensure compatibility, security, and compliance.
1.8.	Project Risk Management
Regular identification, assessment, and prioritization of risk (budget, skills, schedule, compliance, communication, resources). Strong focus on training, stakeholder communication, and milestone tracking. Use of preventive measures, compliance audits, and regular risk assessments. Risks are identified at the start of the project and continuously throughout all phases of the project. The source of risk includes technical challenges, integration with external systems (ORTUS), resource constraints, regulatory compliance (GDPR, accessibility, EU AI act), and stakeholder engagement. All identified risks are documented in a risk register. Each entry in the risk register includes risk description, probability, impact, owner (responsible person), mitigation and contingency measures, and status. Risks are assessed for their probability and potential impact in a way that high-probability and high-impact risks are prioritized at the top. Major risks that threaten project objectives are escalated to project sponsors and stakeholders promptly. Risk status is regularly reported in monthly progress reports. Some risks at low-probability and low-impact may never impact the project.
1.9.	Project Configuration Management
All project artifacts (source code, documentation, requirements, design documents, test scripts, etc.) are uniquely identified and versioned. A configuration item list is maintained, specifying what is under configuration control. The project uses a version control system in GitHub to manage source code, documentation, configuration files, test cases and test results. Each change in these files is tracked, and history is maintained for audit and rollback purposes. Any changes to configuration items must follow a formal change request procedure and should be reviewed by the project manager. Project manager approves or rejects changes, and the approved changes are then implemented. Regular reports are generated detailing the status of all configuration items (current versions, pending changes, outstanding change requests). This ensures transparency and control over the project’s evolving assets.
1.10.	Project Quality Assurance
A dedicated QA plan is developed at the project’s outset, this plan defines quality objectives and acceptance criteria for all deliverables, standards and methods (IEEE, GDPR, WCAG 2.2, EU AI act.), the QA team structure that is independent from development. Verification ensures that deliverables meet specified requirements at each phase of the EPA project. Validation ensures that the EPA system fulfills user and stakeholder needs in real-world scenarios. Verification and validation are done by peer reviews of code, architecture, requirements, and test cases. Milestones audits are carried out to ensure deliverables meet acceptance criteria and project standards before moving to the next phase. This ensures that the previous phase quality issues are not carried into the next phase. Automated and manual testing is performed at multiple levels by performing unit testing, integration testing, system testing and user acceptance testing. Defect tracking and reporting is enforced throughout all testing phases.
