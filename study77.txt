R E S E A R C H A R T I C L E   Open Access  Struggling with strugglers: using data from selection tools for early identification of medical students at risk of failure  James Li   1   , Rachel Thompson   2   and Boaz Shulruf   2*  Abstract  Background:   Struggling medical students is an under-researched in medical education. It is known, however, that early identification is important for effective remediation. The aim of the study was to determine the predictive effect of medical school admission tools regarding whether a student will struggle academically.  Methods:   Data comprise 700 students from the University of New South Wales undergraduate medical program. The main outcome of interest was whether these students struggled during this 6-year program; they were classified to be struggling they failed any end-of-phase examination but still graduated from the program. Discriminate Function Analysis (DFA) assessed whether their pre-admission academic achievement, Undergraduate Medicine Admission Test (UMAT) and interview scores had predictive effect regarding likelihood to struggle.  Results:   A lower pre-admission academic achievement in the form of Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR) or Grade Point Average (GPA) were found to be the best positive predictors of whether a student was likely to struggle. Lower UMAT and poorer interview scores were found to have a comparatively much smaller predictive effect.  Conclusion:   Although medical admission tests are widely used, medical school rarely use these data for educational purposes. The results of this study suggest admission test data can predict who among the admitted students is likely to struggle in the program. Educationally, this information is invaluable. These results indicate that pre-admission academic achievement can be used to predict which students are likely to struggle in an Australian undergraduate medicine program. Further research into predicting other types of struggling students as well as remediation methods are necessary.  Keywords:   Medical education, Undergraduate, Australia, Prediction, Medical student  Background  Research into medical student selection often focuses on prediction models for identifying applicants who would excel as students and less so on those who are likely to fail [1]. However, there is a group of students known as  ‘ strugglers ’   who   fall   into   neither   of   these   categories. These struggling students are the ones who encounter academic and/or personal difficulties, which causes them to struggle throughout their study in a medical program [1].   Whilst   this   is   a   broad   categorisation,   often   the literature defines such groups differently to one another and uses varying names for the students, such as   ‘ prob- lem learners ’ ,   ‘ at-risk students ’ ,   ‘ disruptive students ’ , and  ‘ marginal students ’   [2, 3]. The prevalence of strugglers is rarely reported but is believed to lie in the range of 10 –  15%   among   undergraduate   medical   programs   [2 – 4], though rates as high as 36.6 – 47.3% of students have been reported to have had impeded progress through their medical course [5]. This number could potentially be explained by the usage of different definitions or the fact that struggling students are often unidentified, or poorly reported [2, 6]. These students often report lower motivation,   increased   frustration   and   boredom,   and lower   confidence   in   their   ability   to   learn   [3,   7].  © The Author(s). 2019   Open Access   This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons license, and indicate if changes were made.

must undertake the end-of-phase examinations at the same point in the medicine program which makes these examinations a more fair and direct comparison between the students. Additionally, students can often proceed with the course and resit a failed course examination at a later point whereas they must successfully pass the end-of-phase exams to proceed. All students that failed during the medical program or dropped out prior to completion were excluded from the analysis. Addition- ally, no students applying through international path- ways were included in the analysis as the admission tools used for those students are different in most cases.  Study population  There were 700 students in our sample of four cohorts that had both admission scores and examination results. The total study population was 700 UNSW undergradu- ate medical program students of which 55.3% were fe- male and 44.7% were male. The 700 were comprised of 77.4% local and 22.6% rural students.  Statistical analysis  We performed a Discriminate function analysis (DFA) to measure how well the current admission tools employed by UNSW were in categorising and differentiating the struggling students from the others. DFA is a statistical procedure that identifies a mathematical function that maximises the accuracy of determining which group a person would belong to, based on the chosen variables [17]. In this study, DFA was used to determine the opti- mal separation of the students into two groups: a strug- gling   and   a   not   struggling   group   based   on   their admission scores. Any student that had to repeat at least one of their end-of-phase assessments or failed an as- sessment   but   completed   the   course   was   classified   as struggling. All other students who graduated from the medicine program without having failed or repeated an end-of-phase assessment were classified as not strug- gling. The struggling status of the students was com- pared against their admission scores of ATAR, UMAT and interview scores using the DFA by IBM SPSS v22.0 [18]. The ATAR stands for   ‘ Australian Tertiary Admis- sion Rank ’   which is a number between 0.00 and 99.95 that indicates a student ’ s position relative to all the stu- dents in their age group in NSW in Australia [19]. Ap- plicants/students coming from other states in Australia may have different secondary school results which are then transformed to an ATAR equivalent. UMAT stands for The Undergraduate Medicine and Health Sciences Admission, which is an aptitudes test measuring three  Fig. 1   Structure of the UNSW medical program  Li   et al.

consensus of these studies as well as the few that have looked   at   struggling   students   is   that   pre-admission ATAR/GPA is the most effective tool in predicting stu- dent performance in the medical program [5, 24 – 27]. This is often assumed to be the case as ATAR/GPA may be a reflection of either an initial shortcoming in bio- logical concepts and processes, or a shortcoming in their academic ability such as their study skills [28].  Future policy and research  Our findings raise two main points with respect to the use   of   these   admission   tools   in   admitting   students. Firstly, our findings agree with the consensus that previ- ous academic achievement (comprised of either ATAR or GPA) seems to be the most effective admission tool in helping to determine which students should be admit- ted, but this does question the use of the interview and UMAT with equal weighting to a student ’ s ATAR or GPA [5, 29]. This is because the other two admission tools have a substantially lower predictive effect than that of the ATAR, though perhaps those two tools are useful in identifying other characteristics that the univer- sity finds desirable in its students [16]. The other issue that our findings raise is that the abil- ity of these admission tools to classify these students is neither ineffective nor infallible, but somewhere in be- tween. One question we must consider is whether we can truly say that we can linearly rank/model these stu- dents, with the students that do best on the upper end of the scale and the students that fail on the lower end of the scale. Whilst the consensus is that previous aca- demic achievement in the form of ATAR/GPA is the most consistent predictor of medical program success [29], the results of this study suggest that it is not per- fect. In that regard, there is the possibility for improve- ment   in   terms   of   admission   tools   which   may   allow better ability to identify students that will struggle as well as in creating a more diverse and desirable range of students. In terms of how these findings could be applied to the medical education and medical programs at various uni- versities, the most straightforward and potentially bene- ficial way would be to assist struggling students early to prevent future struggling throughout their time in the medical program [9]. Currently, universities can only provide support once a student has already been shown to be struggling (e.g. failing an exam) but based on our results universities could offer targeted support to the specific students who are   likely to struggle . This is in comparison to the current situation where, if universities wanted to offer early support, it would realistically have to be broad support to the entire student population. By using our findings in this way universities could assist students   prior   to   them   struggling   and   prevent   these students from suffering the negative consequences of struggling. Even though our results show that ATAR/GPA can be used reasonably reliably to identify struggling students, more research needs to be done intotheeffective long- term remediation to assist these students. Additionally, research delving in to the benefits of the use of the UMAT and interviews as admission tools may prove useful as they may in fact be more predictive of other desirable qualities and thus may lead to greater diversity in the medical student and doctor population [25].  Limitations  The limitations of our study were primarily based on the data we had access to. We were only able to investigate struggling students that had failed in one of the end of phase assessments (as mentioned previously) based on the assessment results we had access to. Because a strug- gling student was defined as one who failed or had to re- peat any end-of-phase assessment but still completed the medicine program, other types of struggling students may have been missed in the scope of this study. Other studies have identified different types of struggling stu- dents such as those that may have to postpone or failed assessment because of illness [28] . Additionally, since this study was focused upon the three main admission tools of UMAT, ATAR/GPA and interview scores, many international students who were admitted without the use of all three of these tools were unable to be included within our study. Being unable to assess all possible dif- ferent categories of struggling students was unavoidable for our project as we were using previously acquired data. For further research, more detailed data and ana- lysis regarding different types of struggling students may provide greater insight in to the predictability of the current admission tools overall.  Conclusions  The results of this study show that ATAR/GPA is effect- ive in predicting which students are likely to be strug- gling within the UNSW medical program. Results of this study could be used by other medical schools to assist in early identification of students that are likely to struggle. This would in turn allow the faculty to monitor, track, support, and remediate the students during their time in the medical program. Doing so early is likely to result in better outcomes for these students as well as better pre- pared and well-equipped physicians entering the medical workforce.

Furthermore,   sstruggling   has   been   shown   to   have   a strong association with withdrawal from the course and has also been shown to have significant negative effect upon both the students themselves as well as the univer- sities they attend [1, 3]. Currently, the main challenge posed by these strug- gling students is the need for effective tools and methods to accurately identify them, so that remediation plans can   be   put   in   place   [7 – 10].   These   students   are   not necessarily incapable of completing their course, and in fact, it has been suggested that up to 95% of the strug- gling medical students do indeed have the essential attri- butes to successfully complete a medical program [11] . G Paul, G Hinman, S Dottl and J Passon [11] survey, found that students enter medical school with the same level of coping and learning skills, which suggests that struggling   students   are   those   who   experience   more trouble managing their time and the course material. Identifying characteristics specific to students within this group and incorporating them into the medical school selection process could be beneficial as this would allow the implementation of early targeted intervention. Con- sidering the scarcity of knowledge on this topic, research into this area is greatly needed. The ideal scenario would be to predict those students who may have future difficulties by using data made available through the medical selection process. Previous research suggests that there are a few factors that may be useful for this purpose: lower grades in biology and late offers to the medical program; male gender [12, 13]; lower high school grades [4, 14]; and an inverse relation- ship between Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) scores and academic difficulty [15]. Some studies re- ported weak associations between demographic charac- teristics (e.g. gender, ethnicity etc.) and struggling, but no evidence was found to suggest that factors other than personal attitudes and aptitudes, or previous educational experiences, have any significant impact on the perform- ance of medical students [4]. The group of strugglers is not negligible and too little is known about how best to identify them early in the program. It is therefore suggested that research should be undertaken which aims to: (1) establish a valid set of criteria for identifying struggling students; (2) identify factors that best predict struggling performance; and (3) identify methods for effective intervention. The current study focuses on points (1, 2), whereas point (3) should be addressed in future research.  Method  Setting  The University of New South Wales (UNSW) is one of the number of medical schools in New South Wales. Ranking for each admission is based on an average of the student ’ s overall UMAT score, structured interview, and GPA or ATAR (which is a measure of pre-admission academic achievement). Predictor (independent) variables were the student scores on these three admission tools (Table 1). The outcome (dependent) variable (Table 1) was derived from whether the student had failed any end-of-phase examination but still graduated from the program, but who had still graduated from the UNSW medical program. The six-year UNSW undergraduate medicine program has   a   modular   structure   comprising   fully   integrated courses   studies   over   26   teaching   periods,   each   of   8 weeks duration (Fig. 1). During each of these courses students must sit course examinations. The program is divided in to three phases based on the approach to learning in each phase. Phase 1 consists of eight 8-week courses in years 1 and 2. Phase 2 consists of clinical courses in Year 3 and the Independent Learning Project in Year 4 (students spend this year undertaking a re- search project). Phase 3 consists of ten clinical place- ment courses in years 5 and 6 (Fig. 1). To successfully pass through each phase, students must pass through the end-of-phase examinations: an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE), a portfolio examination, and a written examination [16].  Study design  The present study examines four consecutive cohorts (commencing years 2006 – 9) of students that have been through and graduated from the UNSW undergraduate medical program in recent years (admissions and assess- ment outcomes). We established a data set that com- bined student ’ s admission scores and their examination results by cross-referencing their identification numbers. Each student was categorised as struggling or not strug- gling; struggling students were defined as any student who failed any end-of-phase examination but still gradu- ated from the program. Only the results of the end-of- phase examinations were used as other examinations throughout   the   program   are   mostly   modular   which means that students might undertake them at different times in their course. In comparison, all the students  Table 1   List of variables Predictor Variables   Description UMAT   Mean score across all three UMAT sections ATAR (or equivalent) Measure of prior academic achievement, either from secondary school (ATAR) or from attendance at a previous university program (GPA) Interview   Total score of their UNSW admission interview Outcome variable Struggling Status Whether the student had failed in any of the major course assessment (described below) whilst still completing the UNSW medicine program.

domains: Logical Reasoning and Problem Solving; Un- derstanding People; and Non-verbal Reasoning [20]. The DFA generates a function that best discriminates between   this   subgroup   of   students   and   the   other students.  Ethics approval  The research was conducted under the ethics approval granted by the Human Research Ethics Committee ofthe University of New South Wales (reference, HC15421, HREAPG: Health, Medical, Community and Social).  Consent  The ethics approval does not require consent from par- ticipants (either for using the data for research or for publication), thus such consent was not obtained. This study used administrative data held UNSW Medicine.  Results  Of the 700 students, 35 were defined to be   ‘ struggling ’  or have struggled during their degree program. Based on the results of the DFA (Table 2), with 73.7% of the cases being correctly classified we proceeded to examine the unstandardized   discrimination   function   coefficients. Based on these results, all three of the admission tools we were investigating were found to negatively predict  ‘ strugglers ’ . The use of the three admission tools in pre- dicting which students are likely to struggle produced an odds ratio of 2.05,(95% CI 1.02 – 4.13,   p   = 0.044). When comparing the standardised function coefficients (Table 3), ATAR had the greatest impact in predicting which stu- dents were likely to struggle: the lower the ATAR, the greater   the   likelihood   of   the   student   struggling.   The ATAR was found to have a 3 – 4 times greater impact in predicting who is likely to struggle in comparison to UMAT and interview scores. The mathematical function produced by the DFA is summarised by the Canonical Discriminate Function Co- efficients and the Group centroids (Table 3). Using the corresponding coefficients for each admission factor the optimal cut-score can be produced. Since struggling is a negative value whereas not-struggling is a positive value, any student that falls above the cut-score determined by the DFA would be most likely to be not struggling com- pared to any student that is below the cut-score. The stan- dardised values allow a comparison of the predictive effect of each admission factor and this shows that ATAR (or equivalent) has the greatest predictive effect of struggling students   out   of   the   three   admission   tools   that   were analysed.  Discussion  This   study   focused   on   an   overlooked,   yet   important topic in medical student admissions, while determining whether   or   not   selection   tools   (ATAR,   UMAT,   and interview scores) had any utility in identifying which stu- dents would most likely struggle during an Australian undergraduate medical program. We found that all three admission scores had a slight association, but that the ATAR had the strongest inverse association out of the three admission tools in differentiating struggling stu- dents from the other students.  Comparison to other studies  This study is both novel in the target population we ex- amined as well as in the techniques utilized. Most stud- ies in this area primarily focus on the use of admission tools in identifying students that are most likely to per- form well at university, or in identifying those that are likely to fail [21, 22]. This study differs by focusing upon the lesser-researched population of   ‘ struggling ’   students [21, 22]. For the purposes of this study, the focus was on students who struggle academically; defined as any stu- dent that successfully graduated from the program but had encountered issues with the course (e.g. failing one or more exams) (see: Method section). The second novel aspect of this project was in the use of DFA for explor- ing the effectiveness of current medical school selection tools [23]. Other current research regarding admission tools and medical school performance are generally focused on students that excel and students that fail as opposed to looking   at   the   struggling   students   in   between.
