However,  most respondents ( n   =   11, 79%) indicated that   >   75% of  the students do not ask questions in class and never seek  advice on their performance.  An additional preparatory year before student admis -  sion   was   among   the   most   frequent   suggestions   for  improving   student   academic   performance.   Table   2  presents the respondents’ suggestions to reduce the attri -  tion rate.  Thematic analysis  Preadmission requirement  Due to the varying assessment standards among high  schools in the UAE, the participants believed that the  CMHS written admission examination is essential for  a fair evaluation of the level of all applicants. Medical  students must be proficient in English in order to study  medicine, but incorporating extended English language  courses in the school curriculum might create time con -  straints and increase student burden.

In one study, one-third of students  considered dropping out during the first two years of  medical school [ 7 ]. However, data are limited on the rea -  sons and risk factors for the high attrition rate among  Emirati medical students.  Medical school attrition is a complex issue due to the  interplay of different factors on students’ academic prog -  ress and decisions to withdraw from medical school [ 8 ].  Early attrition could be associated with mental health  problems, socioeconomic factors, medical school poli -  cies, and the curriculum [ 9 – 11 ]. Economic disadvantages  and racial underrepresentation in the medical field were  also found to increase the risk of attrition from medical  schools [ 12 ].  The high rate of early medical school attrition in UAE  (~   30%) is a concern [ 13 ]. Generally, Emirati medical  Introduction  Medical student attrition worldwide occurs predomi -  nantly in the early years of medical school [ 1 ,   2 ].

Mental health disorders are perceived to be prevalent among medical  students in UAE. This study aimed to explore educators’ perspectives on the high rate of early medical school attrition  in UAE.  Results   The findings suggest that the early medical school attrition rate is correlated with students’ inadequate  academic readiness and their inability to cope with the psychological demands of studying medicine in English.  To reduce the attrition rate, the educators proposed preparatory courses to enhance students’ self-learning skills  and academic readiness for university studies, along with provision of targeted academic support throughout their  medical studies. Psychological well-being and academic preparedness for studying medicine in English is a prime  target for a program to reduce dropout from medical schools.

Notably, they perceive their psy -  chological well-being as the primary cause of withdrawal  from medical school. Mental health problems could be  either the cause or the consequence of academic strug -  gling. Therefore, soliciting the educators’ perspectives  would be helpful for developing a holistic, contextual  solution to ameliorate medical school attrition. Thus,  this study aims to explore the perspectives of the faculty,  administrators and curriculum leadership on the causes  of and solutions for the high rate of early medical school  attrition.  Materials and methods  This cross-sectional study was conducted at the College  of Medicine and Health Sciences (CMHS) between Janu -  ary and June 2022. The CMHS was established in 1984  in the City of Al Ain, United Arab Emirates. It offers a  six-year MD program that integrates basic and clinical  sciences and includes two years of premedical studies. To  gain an in-depth view of the educators’ experience, the  study sought perspectives from both the faculty and the  curriculum leadership. Ethical approval for this study was  obtained from the Social Sciences Research Ethics Com -  mittee   (reference   number   ERS_2019_6027).   Informed  consent was obtained from each participant. The sur -  vey’s first page contained information on the rationale of  the study and statements ensuring the confidentiality of  respondents. The participants were given the choice to  decline or to proceed to answer the survey questions.  Questionnaire development  A   26-item   self-administered   questionnaire   (Supple -  mentary file) was designed to determine the teachers’  opinions on the high rate of early student attrition. The  questionnaire design took into consideration the fac -  tors proposed in the literature [ 2 – 5 ]. The three main  domains were covered: admission process, learning envi -  ronment, and curriculum in use. Additional questions  were included to explore teachers’ views on measures to  reduce student attrition at the medical school. Nine other  questions were used to identify the demographics and  characteristics of the study participants. The question -  naire items utilized Likert scales and were reviewed by  two independent faculty members at the College of Med -  icine, UAE University (UAEU) to assess the face validity  of the survey items and to provide feedback on the clar -  ity and conciseness of the questions. No major changes  were necessary. The questionnaire was emailed using  Google Forms (Google LLC) and all 34 faculty members  (9 females, 25 males) teaching in the premedical program  were invited to participate in the study. The invitation let -  ter provided a brief explanation of the study and explic -  itly stated that participation was entirely voluntary and  that participants could refuse to participate or to with -  draw at any point without penalty.  Thematic analysis  The results of the survey were used to develop semi-  structured interviews for curriculum leadership, includ -  ing the dean, assistant deans, program directors, and the  chair and members of the undergraduate curriculum  committee.   Eight   interview   sessions   were   conducted  via   Microsoft teams. An interview plan was developed  to guide the sessions, and additional open questions,  prompts and probes were used to elicit more detailed  responses. Each interview lasted approximately one hour.  The information gathered was recorded and repeatedly  reviewed and revised until sufficient data were obtained  to   capture   most   of   the   themes   [ 15 ].   An   inductive  approach to thematic analysis was used, which enabled  an expansive analysis of the entire dataset (Fig.   1 ). The six  steps outlined by Braun and Clarke (2006) were followed  for thematic analysis [ 16 ]. Coding was done manually by  one author (HA). After transcribing the data, the inter -  esting features were coded and data relevant to each code  were collated. Then, themes were generated in relation to  the coded extracts and the entire data set. The generated  themes were reviewed for accuracy of data representa -  tion. After refinement of the themes’ definitions, the final  report was generated.  Results  Fourteen faculty members (3 females, 11 males) teaching  in the preclinical program completed the self-adminis -  tered questionnaire. Of these, 9 (64%) have been teaching  at CMHS for more than 10 years.  Perceived attrition factors  Most of the respondents ( n   =   13, 93%) indicated that poor  time management skills and the inability to cope with  the psychological stress of medical studies were impor -  tant factors hindering the academic performance of stu -  dents and potentially contributing to their dropout from  medical school (Table   1 ) . Four survey participants (29%)  believed that the multiple Min Interview (MMI) was not  useful for selecting students.  Some respondents ( n   =   7, 50%) believed that a heavy  and   overcrowded   curriculum,   excessive   assessment,  and late clinical exposure contribute to student attrition  (Table   1 ) . The human anatomy and biological chemistry  courses were particularly challenging ( n   =   8, 57%). Over -  burdening the curriculum with less important courses  and absence of proper mentorship programs may have  negatively affected the students’ academic performance  and progress.  Most of the faculty ( n   =   11, 79%) felt that the learning  environment is favorable, with faculty members being

BMC Research Notes   (2024) 17:352  addition, most students lack essential skills for engag -  ing in self-directed learning and seeking teacher feed -  back,   mentoring,   or   advice.   Students’   self-motivation  may not be high enough to study medicine, as many of  them might have been pressured by their families to do  so. Many students may have unrevealed psychological  problems. Therefore, establishing a well-being counsel -  ling facility might be necessary to provide psychological  support.  Quote   “ Most students expect to be spoon-fed and refuse  to be weaned off. ”  Curriculum planning  Overassessment is a significant problem in the current  curriculum. The current course grades are a composite  score of multiple mini-summative exams. Student prepa -  ration for many summative assessments burdens their  time management. Summative assessments are usually  not followed by constructive feedback and thus may not  promote learning. Also, examination dates overlap, which  sometimes confuses students. Shortening the less impor -  tant courses and omitting repetitions of subject matter  might save time for more difficult courses. Engaging the  students in peer learning groups may improve their self-  directed learning, self-motivation, and academic level.  Early clinical exposure would help students to learn the  application of basic science concepts.  Quotes   “These multiple assessments made it more diffi -  cult for the students to manage their time and increased  their time constraints.”  “Engagement in peer learning groups may improve  their academic level.”  Discussion  The high attrition rate early in medical school in UAE  compared to other countries is a concern, as it may reflect  a high level of stress among these students [ 5 ]. The transi -  tion from high school to university studies is stressful for  many students. Moreover, for non-native English speak -  ers, the use of English as the instruction language could  exacerbate the levels of stress and academic difficulties.  In this study, the medical school educators consid -  ered inadequate academic and English language skills  as important drivers of the high medical school attri -  tion rate. In contrast to other similar studies, socioeco -  nomic factors seem to be less important in the attrition  phenomenon in UAE [ 12 ,   17 ,   18 ]. The provision of state-  financed higher education makes financial issues of less  concern for Emirati medical students.  Inadequate   academic   preparedness   has   also   been  reported in other university colleges in UAE [ 4 ]. Stu -  dents with poor learning skills and poor psychological  resilience   often   struggle   to   adjust   to   the   academic  demands of university studies [ 11 ,   19 ,   20 ], even though  the medical schools strive to select the best students by  using different measures to guide the admission process  [ 21 – 25 ].  The study participants proposed pre-admission screen -  ing for mental health and academic self-learning skills  to identify students at risk of withdrawal from medical  school. Mental health disorders, in combination with  other academic and personal problems, often deteriorate  throughout medical training. Dropout decisions are often  mediated by failure to integrate students into the institu -  tion’s academic and social systems [ 26 ]. Thus, a referral  system and assignment of individual mentors could pro -  vide early support to avoid dropout decisions. Imple -  menting such a referral system would also increase the  awareness among students and staff of the importance of  early identification and referral of students who struggle  academically.  Limitations  Although we secured adequate representation in the  study responses, the small sample limits the general -  izability of the findings to other medical schools. The  interviews included all key stakeholders in curriculum  management   and   were   thus   considered   representa -  tive within this homogeneous sample [ 15 ]. In addition,  including the perspectives of lifelong educators and tri -  angulating their responses with the leadership interviews  provides additional strength to the inferences drawn  from the study findings. The study findings could be  applicable to other publicly funded undergraduate medi -  cal programs that admit students directly from secondary  school, but they might not be applicable to institutions  that admit international students who pay tuition fees.  We believe that these findings will guide a contextual,  multi-system   approach   to   improving   students’   edu -  cational and learning environments in UAE [ 27 ]. The  approach should consider the dynamic nature of student  attrition and continuously integrate the perspectives of  all stakeholders when redesigning the admission process,  medical curriculum, and teaching program [ 8 ].  Conclusions  An   integrated   multi-system   contextual   approach   is  needed to address the high attrition rate at medical  schools in UAE. Pre-admission screening and targeted  preparatory courses to enhance the students’ academic  self-learning skills would decrease the students’ early  attrition rate. Research is needed to explore the impact of  the secondary school curricula on the readiness of Emi -  rati students for university studies.  Abbreviations
