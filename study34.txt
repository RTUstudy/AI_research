Figure 2:   Exam   S cores   B oxplot per   S tudy   T rack   G rouped by   A dmission   T ype  Figure 2   presents the distribution of   exam scores   for 2017 admission, per study  track and grouped by admission type (CEPU I, CEPU II, Fase I, and Fase II). The  study tracks are color - coded, with Study Track 4 (Actuarial and Business Sciences)  consistently showing the highest median   exam scores   across most admission  types. In contrast, Study Track 3 (Social Sciences, and Humanities) generally  exhibits lower median scores.  Test score variability is   more pronounced in the CEPU I and CEPU II admission  types,   indicating   a wider range of   preparedness   among students. In comparison,  Fase I and Fase II display tighter distributions, indicating more consistent  performance, particularly for Fase I, which is specifically designed for recent high  school graduates.

The analysis begins by examining   dropout   rates in relation to average and  minimum entrance exam score s, showcasing the trends and correlations that  underline the importance of exam thresholds in reducing dropout rates. It then  investigates the trade - offs associated with setting minimum score thresholds,  specifically their effects on both   dropout   rates and the proportion of students  admitted.  Finally, based on these findings, a set of proposed   entrance score threshold s   are  presented, aiming to balance student retention with enrollment capacity. These  thresholds offer a practical and data - driven approach to optimiz e   the admissions  process while maintaining accessibility and aligning with institutional goals for  academic success  Figure 7:   Dropout   Rate vs. Average Exam Score by Study Track  Figure 7   depicts   the relationship between   dropout   rates and average exam scores  for the 2017 cohort,   which   each point representing a study program.

234  http:/ / ijlter.org/index.php/ijlter  Given the indications observed in Figures 7 and 8, which highlight a strong  negative relationship between exam scores and student   dropout   rates, it was  decided to test whether it is possible to establish a threshold value for admission  to the university. The goal of this analysis is to determine if a   minimum entrance  exam score   can serve as an effective predictor of student retention, thereby  optimizing the admissions process and reducing dropout rates. This threshold  would aim to balance inclusivity while   ensuring that admitted students have a  higher likelihood of academic success and program completion.  Figure 9: Portion of   D ropout   R emoved by   E ntrance   S core   T hreshold  Figure 9 illustrates the portion of student   dropout   that could be eliminated by  applying varying   entrance   score thresholds. The curve shows a clear trend: as the  threshold increases, a greater proportion of   dropout   is removed. This relationship  indicates that higher thresholds effectively filter out applicants with a higher  likelihood of dropping out.  At lower thresholds, the reduction in   dropout   is minimal, reflecting the inclusion  of students with varying levels of preparedness. However, as the threshold rises,  the curve steepens, showing a substantial decline in   dropout   rates. This trend  plateaus at higher thresholds, suggesting diminishing returns when setting  excessively high cut - off scores.  The figure highlights the potential of establishing an optimal threshold to  maximize retention while maintaining accessibility. It underscores the importance  of balancing admissions criteria to enhance student success without unnecessarily

In contrast, AA and CH  display weak   correlations. All subject areas show positive correlations during the  first and second semesters. For cumulative averages, the strongest correlation was  VR (0.23), while MR, LA, GT, PH, and LO ranged between 0.14 and 0.17.  For Study Track 3: Social Sciences and Humanities, a consistent moderate positive  correlation is observed for VR, LA, and Geography (GE). Additionally, History  (HI), Literature (LI), and Economy (EC) show moderate positive correlations,  while MR and AA hav e weak correlations. Positive correlations are evident in the  first, second, third, fifth, and eighth semesters. For cumulative averages, the  strongest correlations were for VR (0.23) and LA (0.2), while HI, LI, and GE ranged  between 0.12 and 0.17.  For Study Track 4: Actuarial Sciences and Business, a consistent moderate positive  correlation is seen for MR, while all other correlations are weak. For cumulative  averages, the strongest correlations were for MR (0.26) and EC (0.21).  These findings emphasize how specific subject areas of the   entrance   exam  influence academic performance differently across study tracks. The correlations  provide   valuable   insights   for   refining admission   criteria   to   align   with   the  academic demands of each discipline.

Literature Review  The   relationship   between   entrance   exam   scores   and   subsequent   academic  performance remains a central focus in higher education research. Many studies  report a positive correlation between entrance examination results and university  achievements. However, some   researches   reveal no significant association, and  others emphasize that additional factors (e.g., socioeconomic status, admission  modality,   personal   competencies)   mediate   this   relationship.   The   following  systematization groups relevant recent studies into three main   clusters — those  positing a posit ive correlation, those finding no significant correlation, and those  highlighting other influential factors — followed by a summary table.  2.1. Studies Indicating a Positive Correlation  Several studies across diverse contexts   highlight   a statistically significant positive  relationship between   entrance   exam scores and academic performance. For  example, Baccaro and Shinyashiki (2017) found that entrance exam performance  was positively associated with student success in a Brazilian public university,  suggesting that the exam remained predictive regardless   of career field. In  Nigeria, Oluwatayo and Fajobi (2012) reported that Post - UTME scores correlated  positively   with   Mathematics/Computer   Sci ence   undergraduates’   CGPAs,  particularly during their first year, indicating substantial predictive validity at  early stages of university.  A similar trend was observed by Ilave et al. (2020) at the   San Marcos Major  National University, where students’ entrance exam scores were positively  related to their academic performance coefficient, although the strength of this  correlation was moderate. Likewise, Sackett et al. (2009) demonstrated that,  despite the influence of   socioeconomic status (SES) on   exam scores , the predictive  validity of   entrance s tests remained largely intact after controlling for SES, thus  reinforcing the robustness of such ex ams. In a medical education context, Iftikhar  et al. (2020) showed that standardized   exam scores   (MDCAT) predicted academic  performance in preclinical years and worked in tandem with assessments of non -  cognitive skills to forecast clinical performance.  Additionally, recent studies have expanded on these findings by incorporating  predictive models to assess dropout risks in higher education institutions. Pérez  et al. (2018) developed a multivariate model that accurately predicted first - year  dropout rates   in Chile, identifying key categorical variables that influence student  retention. Similarly, Gutiérrez et al. (2024) employed regression and decision tree  techniques   to optimize   resource   allocation   in   a private Chilean   university,  demonstrating that machin e learning models can enhance dropout predictions.  Ferrão and Almeida (2018) reported that the university entrance score was the  strongest predictor of first - year GPA in Portugal, although its effect varied across

Research   M ethodology  In this section, the research design, research paradigm,   data collection and  processing procedures, and ethical considerations .  3 .1 Research   D esign  This   study   employed   a   quantitative   research   approach   grounded   in   the  postpositivist paradigm, utilizing a longitudinal cohort analysis to investigate the  relationship between   entrance   exam scores, academic performance, and student  dropout . The longitudinal design allowed for the tracking of a cohort of 1,526  students admitted to the   Jorge Basadre Grohmann National University   (UNJBG)  in 2017 over a seven - year period, from admission through to 2024.  A retrospective data analysis strategy was used, leveraging existing institutional  records, i ncluding   entrance   exam scores per subject area   (e.g.,   verbal reasoning,  mathematical reasoning, biology, etc. ), and   university   student   performance . The  retrospective nature of the analysis ensures the use of real - world, pre - existing  data collected for administrative purposes, repurposed here to gain insights into  academic outcomes and student retention.  Unlike experimental or quasi - experimental designs, this study examines naturally  occurring patterns and relationships in the data. By adopting this approach, the  study aims to describe trends in academic performance, analyze the influence of  entrance   exam scores by subject area on both academic success and student  dropout , and explore whether a minimum entrance score threshold can be  established to predict outcomes effectively.  The   analysis   employed   statistical   methods,   including   descriptive   statistics,  correlation analysis (Spearman's rank correlation), and visualization techniques  to explore the relationship between entrance exam scores, academic performance,  and student dropou t. Data processing, statistical analyses, and visualizations  were performed using Python programming language with libraries such as  Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for graphical visualization. Utilizing  these powerful data analysis tools facil itated efficient processing, exploration, and  interpretation   of   large   datasets,   thereby   enabling   robust,   insightful,   and  reproducible findings.  This design provides a robust framework for analyzing the complex interplay  between admission criteria and academic success in the context of   Jorge Basadre  Grohmann National University   and   Peruvian higher education, with findings that  can inform evidence - based policymaking and institutional strategies for student  support and retention.

Data Collection  Figure 1: Data   S election   P rocess for the   S tudy   C ohort,   I ncluding   E xclusion and  I nclusion   C riteria for   S tudents   A dmitted to the Jorge   Basadre Grohmann National  University in 2017  This study utilized institutional records from the Jorge Basadre Grohmann  National University   (UNJBG) to construct a comprehensive dataset of students  admitted in 2017. The data collection process followed a systematic approach to  ensure the inclusion of relevant and accurate records, as described below and  illustrated in Figure 1.  Table 1: Study Tracks and Corresponding Study Programs and Number of Semesters  at the Jorge Basadre Grohmann National   University  Admission Type   CEPU   Fase   Total  I   II   III   I   II  Applicants   818   1399   1169   2002   2441   7829  The initial dataset comprised 7,330 records of entrance exams from the admission  department   for   the   year   2017,   including   both   admitted   and   non - admitted  students. The types of admission include the Centro de Estudios Preuniversitarios  (CEPU) exam, where students attend preparatory classes and are then tested on  what they have learned, and the Fase exam, which is divided into two categories:  Fa se I and Fase II. The Fase I exam is specifically oriented for students who have  just completed secondary school, while the Fase II exam is oriented to all  applicants. The number of applicants for each exam type is presented in Table 1.  All exams are grade d on a scale from 0 to 600.

Page 9:
224  http:/ / ijlter.org/index.php/ijlter  Simultaneously, 1,638 student records were identified   in the university   database  for students who enrolled in   2017, with their academic records spanning the  period from 2017 to 2024.   To enhance data quality, exclusion   criteria were applied.  Specifically, 48 students were excluded due to incomplete or null grading data in  the university records. This refinement resulted in a dataset of 1,590 students who  met the minimum data quality standards.  Records form the   admission department   and   university records were cross -  referenced to   create a unified dataset,   ensuring consistency between sources.  Following this step, inclusion criteria were implemented to finalize the dataset.  Students were included if they satisfied the following conditions:  1.   They passed the entrance exam and had corresponding records in both the  admission and university datasets.  2.   They were admitted through alternative pathways but had taken an  entrance exam with the same subject areas required for their respective  study programs.  Applying these criteria, the final dataset comprised 1,526 students, forming the  cohort analyzed in this study. This dataset provided the foundation for a  longitudinal   analysis   of   entrance   exam   scores,   academic   performance,   and  student retention over a seven - year period, from 2017 to 2024. By adhering to  these rigorous selection processes, the study ensured the validity and reliability  of its findings, aligning with its objectives to examin e the interplay between  admission criteria and academic outcomes.  3 .3. Data   Processing  The processing of entrance exam data involved utilizing records obtained from  the   admissions   department   of   the   (UNJBG).   These   records   included   the  applicants' responses and the corresponding correct answers for the admission  exam.

Additionally, the dataset included temporal information about each student's  academic trajectory, such as:  1.   Start Year: The year the student began their studies.  2.   Last Year of Study: The most recent year in which the student was enrolled  in courses.  To identify student retention, a labeling process was conducted to categorize  students as dropouts. Applicants were labeled as   dropout   if they met the  following criteria:  1.   They were not enrolled in any courses during the penultimate or last  semester of the analysis period.  2.   They were not registered for any courses in 2024.  This systematic approach ensured a comprehensive understanding of students'  academic performance and their enrollment status over the study period, enabling  a detailed examination of retention patterns and academic outcomes.  3 .4.   Ethical   Considerations  This study   adhered to   ethical standards. Approval was obtained from the ethics  committee of the   Jorge Basadre Grohmann National University on October 14th,  2024 , ensuring that the use of institutional data adhered to established ethical  guidelines. The authorization granted allowed for the analysis of academic  records while safeguarding the privacy and confidentiality of the students  involved.  To protect individual identities, all data were anonymized in the final dataset.  Identifiable information was removed, ensuring that it is not possible to trace the  records back to any specific student. These measures were taken to uphold the  principles of   data protection and privacy throughout the research process.  4 . Results and Analysis  4 .1.

Programs within Study Track 1 (Health and Biomedical Sciences) have moderate  failure   rates,   reflecting   consistent   academic   performance   among   students.  Meanwhile, Study Track 2 (Exact Sciences ,   Engineering , and Architecture ) shows  higher failure rates in some demanding programs, such as Engineering fields,  which align with the rigorous nature of these disciplines.  This chart emphasizes the disparities in academic performance across study  programs and tracks, highlighting the need for targeted academic support in  programs with   elevated failure rates.  4 .2.   Relationship   Between Exam Scores   and   Student Dropout  T he relationship between entrance exam scores and student   dropout   rates,  focusing   on   how   academic   preparedness   impacts   retention   outcomes   was  explored . Using regression analyses and visualizations, the data reveals strong

Page 18:
233  http:/ / ijlter.org/index.php/ijlter  These values indicate a robust inverse relationship, where programs with higher  average exam scores consistently exhibit lower   dropout   rates. The clustering of  points   near   the   regression   line   reinforces   the   consistency   of   this   pattern,  highlighting the predictive   value   of average   entrance   exam scores   in forecasting  student   retention.   A   few   outliers   deviate   from   the   trend,   suggesting   that  additional factors may influence   dropout   in certain programs.  Figure 8:   Dropout   Rate vs.   Minimum   E ntrance   E xam   S core   by Study Track  Figure 8 shows the relationship between   dropout   rates and   minimum entrance  exam score s for the same cohort. Each point represents a program, and the  regression lines depict a clear negative trend between   minimum entrance exam  score s and   dropout   rates. Programs with higher   minimum entrance exam score s  tend to have lower   dropout   rates, confirming the predictive importance of  entrance thresholds, supported by Spearman correlation score of   - 0.77.  Together, these figures demonstrate a strong and consistent relationship between  entrance   exam   scores   and   student   dropout   rates.   The   correlation   values  emphasize   the   importance   of entrance   exam   scores   in predicting   retention  outcomes. These insights support the use of exam scores   as criteria   in admissions  policies   aimed at reducing   dropout rates and   enhancing student success .

Page 20:
235  http:/ / ijlter.org/index.php/ijlter  restricting access to higher education.   However, increasing the threshold may  result in a significant reduction in the number of students admitted, as stricter  score requirements would exclude more applicants from the admissions process.  This trade - off underscores the need for careful considerat ion in determining an  appropriate threshold that balances student retention with enrollment capacity.  To further explore this relationship, the figure 10 is calculated to analyze how  varying   the   threshold   impacts   the   proportion   of   students   who   meet   the  admissions criteria. This analysis will provide valuable insights into the potential  effects of different   threshold levels on the university ’ s enrollment size, ensuring  that   the   proposed   threshold   aligns   with   institutional   goals   and   resource  availability.  Figure 10: Portion of   A dmitted by   E ntrance   S core   T hreshold  Figure 10 illustrates the proportion of applicants admitted as the   entrance   score  threshold increases. The curve reveals a declining trend, where higher thresholds  result in a progressively smaller portion of students meeting the criteria for  admission. This decrease highlights the trade - off between raising the threshold to  enhan ce retention and the potential reduction in the total number of admitted  students.  At lower thresholds,   the   majority of   applicants   are   eligible   for admission,  maintaining broad accessibility. However, as the threshold rises, the proportion  of admitted students drops sharply, particularly at mid - range thresholds. This  trend begins to leve l off at higher thresholds, where only a small fraction of  applicants would qualify.

Page 21:
236  http:/ / ijlter.org/index.php/ijlter  The figure underscores the importance of carefully balancing the   entrance   score  threshold to ensure that while student retention is improved, the number of  admitted students does not fall below sustainable levels. These insights are  relevant for designing admission policies that align with institutional goals for  accessibility   and academic success.  Taking into account both criteria, the proportion of   dropout   removed and the  proportion of admitted students when applying a threshold, Table 4 presents the  proposed   entrance score threshold s for each study track. The threshold represents  the minimum score required to be admitted, aiming to balance student retention  with the number of admitted students. These thresholds are designed to optimize  retention by reducing   dropout   while maintaining an acceptable number of  admitted students:  Table 4: Proposed   Entrance   S core   T hreshold s and Their Impact on Enrollment and  Retention  Study  Track   Threshold   % Reduction in admitted  students  %   Dropout s  removed  1   220/600   16.56%   24.29%  2   200/600   18.32%   28.80%  3   200/600   12.84%   22.85%  4   300/600   12.91%   37.77%  This proposal represents a balanced approach to improving retention rates while  minimizing the impact on enrollment capacity, aligning with the   institutional goal  of enhancing academic success and reducing dropout rates.  4 . 3 .

The correlations range from negative to positive,  highlighting   the   subject areas that   most significantly correlate with   academic  performance.  For Study Track 1: Health and Biomedical Sciences, there is a moderate positive  correlation for Verbal Reasoning (VR), Language (LA), and Biology (BI), while  Mathematical Reasoning (MR), Arithmetic and Algebra (AA), Geometry and  Trigonometry (GT), Physics   (PH), and Chemistry (CH) show a moderate negative  correlation. Notably, all subject areas have a positive correlation in the first  semester. Over cumulative averages, the strongest positive correlations were  observed for VR (0.24), LA (0.31), and BI (0.28) .

This study investigates the relationship between   entrance   exam  scores and academic performance, as well as their implications for  student retention, at the Jorge Basadre Grohmann National University  (UNJBG). Using data from 1,526 students admitted in 2017 and tracked  through 2024, the analysis explores   entrance   scores by subject area,  average academic performance, and   dropout   rates across four study  tracks. Results reveal that Verbal Reasoning (VR) and Language (LA)  consistently   exhibit   moderate   positive   correlations   with   academic  performance, while discipline - sp ecific subjects such as Biology (BI) and  Mathematical   Reasoning   (MR)   show   varying   levels   of   influence  depending on the study track. A strong negative relationship between  entrance   scores and   dropout   rates was identified, supported by Spearman  correlations of   - 0.8 (average scores) and   - 0.77 (minimum scores). Based on  these findings, a data - driven admission policy is proposed, introducing  track - specific minimum score thresholds designed to reduce   dropout  rates while maintaining accessibility.   T he proposed thr eshold for Health  and Biomedical Sciences would   result in eliminate 24.29% of dropouts by  reduc ing admissions by only   16.56%. The study underscores the value of  aligning admission criteria with program - specific academic demands and  highlights the potential   of   advanced data science techniques to refine  predictive models and identify more nuanced patterns. These insights  contribute to the development of evidence - based admission policies that  optimize   retention   and   support   long - term   academic   success   in   the  Per uvian higher education context.  Key words:   entrance   exams ;   student   dropout ;   academic performance  1.   Introduction  Entrance   exams are a   fundamental component   of higher education systems  worldwide, serving as a critical tool for evaluating prospective students and  * Corresponding author:   Americo Chaparro - Guerra ,   achaparrog@unjbg.edu.pe

These   standardized  assessments aim to measure cognitive abilities, subject - specific knowledge, and  readiness for the academic rigor of university programs. Their importance lies not  only in facilitatin g access to education but also in predicting academic success  during higher education   (Sawyer, 2007).   Understanding the relationship between  entrance   exam performance and subsequent academic achievement is vital for  refining admission policies and fostering student success.  Numerous studies have explored the predictive validity of   entrance   exams across  diverse   contexts   and   disciplines.   For   instance,   Yang   (2020)   examined   the  correlation between subject - specific   entrance   tests and undergraduate academic  performance in China, revealing significant variability in their predictive power  depending on the academic discipline and admission track. These findings  underscore the nuanced relationship between different components of   entrance  exams and university success, suggesting the nee d for a tailored approach to  admissions that accounts for discipline - specific requirements.  Critics of   entrance   exams often argue that these tests may reflect socioeconomic  disparities rather than true academic potential.   Sackett et al. (2009)   addressed this  concern by analyzing large datasets and demonstrating that while socioeconomic  status (SES) influences   exam scores , the predictive validity of these scores for  academic performance remains largely independent of SES. This highlights the  robustness of   entrance   exams as a tool for assessing academic potential, though it  also calls attention to t he broader context of equity in education.  In   the   healthcare   education   domain,   studies   have   shown   that   integrated  admission criteria — including cognitive and non - cognitive measures — are more  effective in predicting academic performance than relying solely on standardized  tests.   Iftikhar et al. (2020)   found that medical college admission criteria combining  academic   exam scores   with assessments of communication, empathy, and ethics  provided a more comprehensive prediction of success in clinical years. Similarly,  Diarsvitri et al. (2020)   emphasized the i mportance of considering psychological  and demographic factors alongside academic tests to estimate students’ academic  success in preclinical medical education.  The relationship between prior academic performance, as reflected in high school  grades, and university success has also been a focus of research. High school GPA  often emerges as a stronger predictor of first - year college GPA than standardized  exam scores   in less selective institutions, while the opposite is true for highly  selective   universities (Sawyer, 2007). Poláčková and Svatošová (2012)   further  illustrated this point in their study of economics students, where   entrance   exam  results were found to corr elate significantly with average progress in bachelor’s  programs.  In Latin America, there is limited research on the predictive validity of   entrance  exams, despite their widespread use.   Baccaro and Shinyashiki (2017)   investigated  this relationship at a public university in São Paulo, Brazil, and found that  entrance exam performance was positively associated with academic success  across various disciplines, regardless of career field.   Their findings emphasize the

Page 3:
218  http:/ / ijlter.org/index.php/ijlter  influence of entrance modalities and personal factors on student performance,  underscoring the importance of further localized studies in the region.   These  findings align with international research but also highlight the need for more  localized studies to address region - specific educational challenges.  In Peru, each university   has the   autonom y   to   determine its   admission   procedures .  All national universities in Peru, where competition for admission is fierce,  conduct an   entrance   test. For example,   San Marcos Major   National University  conducts   entrance   tests with a total of 17 subject areas where the number of  questions per subject area depends on   4 study tracks .  At   Jorge Basadre Grohmann National   University   (UNJBG)   in Tacna,   Peru,  entrance   exams play a pivotal role in the selection process for undergraduate  programs. The   entrance   test consists of exams per   study track   (that group the  study programs), each with different 8 subject areas and variable number of  questions. In 2024, 14,683 applicants took the   entrance   exam to gain entry into one  of the 34 study programs, but only 1,794 were admitted (12.21%), whereas for the  Medicine study program the acceptance rate was just 1.67% (30 students).  However, the extent to which these tests are relat ed to academic performance  remains unexplored .  Despite extensive research exploring the relationship between entrance exam  scores, academic performance, and student retention, a significant gap remains in  understanding this dynamic within the specific context of Peruvian higher  education. Specifically,   little is known about how entrance exam scores influence  student outcomes at UNJBG, particularly regarding their predictive validity for  academic success and retention across different programs and subject areas.  Addressing this gap is crucial to inform e vidence - based admission policies  tailored to local contexts and academic demands.  This study aims to address this gap by conducting an in - depth analysis of the  relationship   between   entrance   exam   scores   and   academic   performance  throughout students' university careers at UNJBG, focusing on 1,526 students  admitted in 2017 whose records have been tracked until 2024, making it a long -  term longitudinal study.   From this cohort, 500 students dropped out, representing  a significant   dropout   rate   of   32.76%. This   highlights   the pressing need to  investigate factors contributing to   dropout , such as   en trance   exam scores and  scores per subject area, to develop strategies that improve retention and support  academic success.   Using a   data - driven approach and visualization tools, this  research   examines   entrance   exam   scores   by   subject   area,   providing  comprehensive insights into their impact on academic performance and student  retention within the Peruvian higher education context. Three main research  objectives   are   addressed:   (i)   To   describe   the   exam   scores   and   a cademic  performance of students. (ii)   To analyze the r elationship between exam scores and  student   dropout . (i ii ) To   analyze the relationship between exam scores by subject  area and academic performance.  The   findings   of   this   study   have   significant   implications   for   policymakers,  educators,   and   university   administrators.   The   insights   gained   from

Page 5:

(2020) found that cognitive   entrance   exam  scores , along with a psychological test, significantly correlated with academic  success in the preclinical stage of a medical program in Indonesia.  Taken together, these studies suggest that   entrance   tests can serve as valid  indicators of future academic performance, particularly in the early semesters or  preclinical stages of professional programs. Nonetheless, many highlight the  attenuating effect of time — predictive power often diminishes after the   first or  second academic year — and the role of complementary factors (e.g., non - cognitive  skills, motivation, socioeconomic background).  2.2. Studies Reporting No Significant Correlation  A   group   of   investigations   has   found   no   statistically   significant   correlation  between admission criteria and subsequent performance, questioning the extent  to   which   exam   scores   alone   can   predict   academic   success.   For   instance,  Rudhumbu   and   Mudau   (2020)   concluded   that   undergraduate   degree  classifications   in   Zimbabwe   did   not   significantly   influence   postgraduate  performance, implying that prior academic achievements, as screening t ools, had  limited predictive power at the advanced level.  In Turkey, Metli and Özcan (2020) showed that International Baccalaureate  Diploma Program scores did not have a significant correlation with students’ rank  order in a university entrance exam, suggesting that IBDP results might not be a  strong predictor of   entrance exam outcomes. Similarly, Nugraha (2021) found no  positive relationship between high university entrance scores and the academic  achievement of first - year students, reinforcing the notion that   entrance   exam  success may not always translate into f avorable performance once enrolled.  Opazo et al. (2021) further contribute to this discussion by demonstrating that  different   universities   exhibit   distinct   dropout   predictors,   emphasizing   that  applying a universal predictive model across institutions may not always yield  accurate results. Th eir study found that machine learning models perform best  when tailored to individual universities rather than generalized across multiple  institutions.  2.3. Studies Highlighting Other Influential Factors  A third cluster of research indicates that while entrance exam scores may or may  not be relevant, a host of additional factors — such as policy interventions,  admission modality, socio - demographic variables, and personal competencies —  play crucial roles in academic outcomes.  Recent studies have highlighted the impact of economic, institutional, and  psychological factors on university dropout rates. Núñez - Naranjo (2024) analyzed  dropout   determinants   in Ecuador,   revealing   that   socioeconomic   conditions,  academic background, and i nstitutional support significantly influence student  retention. Similarly, Wild and Heuling (2020) applied event history analysis to  cooperative education students in Germany, identifying workplace commitment  and personality traits as significant factors i n dropout risk.

Using the study track assigned to each applicant and the order of questions in  their   respective   entrance   exams,   the   data   were   processed   to   calculate   the  percentage of correctly answered questions for each subject area. This step  allowed for a detailed analysis of applicants' performance by subject area within  their respective study tracks. This processing en sured that the data accurately  reflected applicants' proficiency across the different components of the   entrance  exam.  For the data corresponding to academic performance obtained from the university  database, several metrics were calculated to facilitate analysis. For each   student,  the following measures were derived:  1.   Average GPA: The mean grade obtained across all enrolled courses   each  semester and in total.  2.   Enrolled Courses: The number of courses in which the student was  officially registered   each semester and in total.

Discussion  The findings of this study provide significant insights into the relationship  between   entrance   exam scores and academic performance, as well as their  implications for student   dropout   and retention. By analyzing   entrance   exam  scores by subject area, average performance, and course failure rates, this study  builds   on   existing   literature   while   addressing   region - specific   challenges   in  Peruvian higher education.  The correlation analysis revealed that subject areas such as Verbal Reasoning (VR)  and Language (LA) consistently exhibit positive correlations with academic  performance across multiple study tracks. These findings align with existing  research emphasizing   the predictive value of language and reasoning skills for  academic success (Baccaro & Shinyashiki, 2017; Aguilar - Ruiz et al., 2021). In Study  Tracks 1 (Health and Biomedical Sciences) and 2 ( Exact   Sciences, Engineering, and  Architecture), subject areas lik e Biology (BI) and Mathematical Reasoning (MR)  also showed moderate positive correlations, highlighting their relevance to  discipline - specific demands.  Interestingly, Study Tracks 3 (Social Sciences and Humanities) and 4 (Actuarial  Sciences   and   Business)   demonstrated   unique   patterns,   where   subjects   like  Geography   (GE)   and   Economy   (EC)   were   more   strongly   correlated   with  performance, suggesting that the ali gnment of   entrance   exams with program -  specific skills may enhance their predictive validity. These   findings   suggest  tailoring   admission criteria   to match   program - specific academic requirements, as  recommended by other   studies (Yousafzai & Jamil, 2019; Polá čková & Svatošová,  2020).  Figures 7 and 8 highlighted a strong negative relationship between   entrance   exam  scores and   dropout   rates, with Spearman correlation values of   - 0.8 (average  scores) and   - 0.77 (minimum scores), respectively. These findings emphasize the  critical role of entrance exam performance in predicting retention outcomes.  Programs   with   higher   average   and   minimum   entrance   scores   consistently  demonstrated   lower   dropout   rates, underscoring the importance of academic  preparedness at the time of admission.  The findings align with international evidence showing that entrance thresholds  can effectively predict student retention (Sawyer, 2020; Ali et al., 2021). However,  the presence of outliers in the data suggests that non - academic factors, such as  financial   challenges or institutional support, may also influence   dropout   rates.  These findings highlight the need for a holistic approach that combines academic  thresholds with broader student support systems.  Figures 9 and 10   illustrate   the trade - offs   associated with   setting   entrance   score  thresholds. While higher thresholds significantly reduced   dropout   rates, they also  decreased the proportion of admitted students, highlighting the challenge of  balancing retention with accessibility. The proposed thresholds (Table 4) aim to  optimize this balance, with thresholds for Study Tracks 1 through 4 targeting

Page 24:
239  http:/ / ijlter.org/index.php/ijlter  reductions in   dropout   rates between 22.85% and 37.77%, while maintaining an  acceptable reduction in admissions (12.84% to 18.32%).  These results   support   research advocating for data - driven admission policies that  consider both academic success and enrollment capacity (Golding & McNamarah,  2018; Diarsvitri et al., 2022). Importantly, the results emphasize that thresholds  should be context - specific, accounti ng for institutional priorities and regional  educational challenges.  Despite these valuable insights, this study presents several limitations. First, the  analysis relied exclusively on academic records and entrance exam scores, lacking  direct consideration of critical non - academic variables such as socioeconomic  factors,   ps ychological   attributes,   and   personal   motivations,   all   previously  identified in the literature as influential predictors of student success (Iftikhar et  al., 2023; Diarsvitri et al., 2024). Additionally, the predictive power of entrance  exams appears to dim inish over time; thus, the conclusions drawn about long -  term   academic   performance   must   consider   other   potentially   intervening  variables, such as changes in personal circumstances or institutional support.  This study offers practical recommendations for refining admission policies at the  National   University Jorge Basadre   Grohmann.   By   aligning   thresholds with  program - specific academic demands, the institution can enhance retention while  maintaining equitable   access.  6 . Conclusions and Recommendations  This study provided a comprehensive analysis of   entrance   exam scores and their  relationship with academic performance and student   dropout   at the National  University Jorge Basadre Grohmann. The findings addressed the three main  research objectives, offering valuable insights into the role of   entrance   scores in  shaping student outcomes.  T he study described the distribution of exam scores and academic performance,  highlighting significant variations across study tracks and programs.   T he analysis  established a robust negative relationship between exam scores and student  dropout   rates. Programs with higher average and minimum scores exhibited  consistently lower   dropout   rates, as supported by Spearman correlation scores of  - 0.8 and   - 0.77, respectively. These findings underscored the predictive power of  entrance exam performance for retention o utcomes.  T he analysis of   entrance   exam scores by subject area showed distinct correlations  with academic performance across study tracks, highlighting the predictive value  of   specific   skills.   Verbal   Reasoning   (VR)   and   Language   (LA)   consistently  demonstrated moderate positive correlations   with cumulative averages across  most tracks, while Biology (BI) and Mathematical Reasoning (MR) were notably  significant   in   Health   and   Biomedical   Sciences   and   Actuarial   Sciences,  respectively. Other subject areas, such as Geography   (GE), History (HI), and  Literature (LI), showed moderate positive correlations in Social Sciences and  Humanities, reflecting discipline - specific academic demands. These findings

Page 25:
240  http:/ / ijlter.org/index.php/ijlter  emphasize the importance of aligning admission criteria with program - specific  requirements to optimize student success.  Overall, the study demonstrated that setting   entrance score threshold s could  effectively balance retention and accessibility. The proposed thresholds   provide  an   evidence - based   approach   to reduc ing   dropout   rates while   minimizing impacts  on admission numbers .  Based on the correlations identified between   entrance   exam subject areas and  academic   performance,   it   is   recommended   to   refine   admission   criteria   by  prioritizing subject areas that show stronger predictive value for success in  specific study tracks. The proposed policy includes implementing minimum score  thr esholds tailored to each track, as outlined in Table 4, to enhance student  retention while maintaining alignment with academic demands. This targeted  approach ensures a data - driven admissions process that supports long - term  student success.  7 .   Future Research  This study highlights the potential for further exploration using the available data  to enhance understanding of the relationship between   entrance   exam scores,  academic performance, and retention. Future research could leverage advanced  data science techniques to uncover more complex patterns and interactions.  Methods such as machine learning and predictive modeling could identify non -  linear relatio nships and latent variables, providing deeper insights into student  performance and retention dynamics. These   techniques may also refine the  identification of optimal   entrance score threshold s and help predict long - term  academic outcomes.  Another promising   approach   is the clustering of study programs based on  performance metrics, retention rates, and other characteristics, independent of the  current study track classification. This approach could reveal new groupings that  reflect underlying similarities among program s, enabling more targeted analysis  and tailored admission policies.  Expanding   the analysis to include additional cohorts and   examining   trends over  multiple years would help   assess   the consistency of the observed patterns. Such  longitudinal studies would validate the robustness of the findings and uncover  whether   the   relationships   between   entrance   exam   scores   and   academic  performance evolve over time or remain stable across cohorts.   To further validate  the findings, future research should incorporate a broader set of variables,  including non - cognitive skills, socioeconomic f actors, and institutional support  structures,   thus   offering   a   holistic   understanding   of   student   retention  determinants. Expanding this analytical framework across multiple universities  could   enhance   generalizability,   offering   broader   implications   for   natio nal  education policy.  Given the evolving landscape of dropout prediction and student retention  strategies, integrating machine learning and advanced statistical methods, as

Page 26:
241  http:/ / ijlter.org/index.php/ijlter  demonstrated by recent studies (Pérez et al., 2018; Opazo et al., 2021; Gutiérrez et  al., 2024), may provide higher education institutions with more precise tools for  intervention. These insights underscore the need for context - specific research to  tailor   predictive models that enhance retention efforts in diverse academic  environments.  By continuing to analyze and expand upon this dataset, future research can  provide   even   more   actionable   insights   for   refining   admissions   policies,  optimizing retention strategies, and supporting long - term academic success.  8 .

221  http:/ / ijlter.org/index.php/ijlter  Deng et al. (2020) focused on Yunnan’s Preferential Admission Policies (PAPs) for  ethnic   minorities.   Their   findings   highlight   how   geographical   remoteness,  linguistic   barriers,   and   socioeconomic   constraints   necessitate   policy - driven  support, overshadowing t he sole predictive power of cognitive   exam scores .  Aguilar - Ruiz et al. (2021) found that the modality of entrance (e.g., specialized  track,   direct   entry)   constituted   a   key   variable   explaining   first - semester  performance for Engineering students in Peru, alo ngside personal interests and  habits such as media consumption. Ponce - Sanchez and Quinteros (2022) similarly  documented that at the National University of Engineering (UNI) in Lima,  students’ academic performance significantly depended on the route used fo r  admission (ordinary, direct, or school - based), underscoring that   exam scores  alone did not fully explain variations in subsequent performance.  Kalaycıoğlu (2019) demonstrated that student - centered activities were negatively  associated   with   both   Turkish - social   and   mathematics - science   exam   results,  whereas teacher - centered activities had a positive relationship with Turkish -  social science scores. M oreover, student interest and self - perception of success in  each subject area emerged as critical factors.   Furthermore, Wild et al. (2024)  explored   how   motivation   and   lecturer   support   influence   dropout   rates   in  cooperative   education   programs,   identifying   t hat   perceived   support   from  instructors can mitigate dropout risk. Their findings emphasize the importance of  integrating student support services into higher education retention strategies.  These   studies   emphasize   that   contextual   variables — ranging   from   regional  policies to instructional approaches — can be just as decisive as (or even more  decisive than) entrance exam scores in influencing university success.  2. 4 . Concluding Remarks on Related Works  Overall, a majority of the reviewed studies find positive though often variable  correlations between   entrance   exam performance and subsequent university  achievement. However, an important subset of research concludes that   entrance  exam scores   do not significantly predict success for all students, especially when  broader institutional, socioeconomic, and personal variables enter the equation.  Still   other   investigations   highlight   additional   factors,   such   as   admission  modalities, non - cognitive sk ills, teaching   methods, and equity policies, which can  reshape or moderate the effect of   entrance   exam scores .  These mixed findings   highlight   the   need for further   research on   the relationship  between entrance   exam results   and   academic performance   in   specific institutional  contexts. In particular, exploring this relationship at the Jorge Basadre Grohmann  National University (UNJBG) in Peru, where there is a high   dropout   rate,  promises to yield valuable insights. Indeed, focusing on   entrance   tests as the  primary criterion for university selection and examining their predictive power  for both persistence ( dropout ) and   success stands as an essential step toward  improving   admission   policies   and   student   outcomes   in   Peruvian   higher  education.
