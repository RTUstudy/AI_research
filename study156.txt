BMC Medical Education   (2024) 24:868  Introduction  The global shortage of healthcare workers is a pervasive problem [1, 2], and the attrition of medical students has undeniably exacerbated this crisis. A meta-analysis has shown an average 9.1% attrition rate among global medi- cal students [3], with a more recent study revealing even higher rates in low -   and middle-income countries—up to 16% in Pakistan and 20.8% in Nigeria [4]. In China, a recent in 2019 recorded a 13.04% dropout rate for Chi- nese medical students [5]. Dropout from high school has been conceptualized as a gradual process that starts with a perception of unsuit- ability and thoughts of dropping out, culminating in the final decision to actually dropout [6]. An empirical longi- tudinal study suggests that dropout intentions and actual dropouts share similar risk and protective factors [7]. This study also identifies a positive association between dropout   intentions   and   actual   dropouts   [7].   Taken together, these findings suggest that dropout intention could be early stage of the dropout process, and identi- fying and targeting dropout intention might contribute to the prevention of actual dropout. In China, the preva- lence rate of dropout intention among medical students is high [5, 8–10]. For example, Cai et al. reported that nearly three-fifths of Chinese medical undergraduates expressed strong turnover intentions [10], a rate substan- tially higher than those in other countries such as U.S., Czech Republic, and Thailand (roughly 20%) [11–13]. These alarming statistics highlight an urgent need to explore potential risk factors and identify students at risk of dropping out. Although mental health issues such as burnout, depres- sion, stress, and substance use have been recognized as significant predictors for dropout intention in medical students worldwide [12–15], their interrelation has been comparatively overlooked in the Chinese context. Previ- ous studies on Chinese medical students have primar- ily concentrated on work-related factors like violence, working hours, and prestige tied to medical careers [9, 10]. A more comprehensive approach, integrating both individual and work-related elements, is essential to fully comprehend the potential risk factors contributing to attrition. A nomogram is a graphical representation of a predic- tive function stemming from a logistic regression model, facilitating   the   quantification   of   individual   probabili- ties for adverse outcomes by synthesizing various vari- ables [16]. Unlike conventional statistical techniques, a nomogram offers an accessible, visually intuitive method to evaluate risk, rendering it valuable to educators and policymakers. Recent studies have increasingly utilized nomograms to ascertain risks of adverse events in stu- dents, such as suicidality, anxiety, and sleep disturbances [17–19]. However, no known prior study has established a nomogram for medical students’ dropout intention. Therefore, this study aims to amalgamate an extensive range of individual and work-related factors to construct a nomogram for dropout intention among Chinese medi- cal undergraduates. The application of this model holds potential for the early identification of students at risk, thereby contributing to a broader understanding and pre- vention of attrition within medical education.  Method  Study procedure and participants  This study utilized a repeated web-based cross-sectional design, conducted in two phases. The initial survey (T1) was carried out from August 2020 to April 2021, followed by a second survey (T2) in October 2022. A detailed description of the study procedure and measurements in T1 can be found in previous publication [8]. Briefly, medical undergraduates from various Chinese colleges were recruited using snowball sampling. The online questionnaire, hosted on WJX (a popular ques- tionnaire website), was disseminated through WeChat, a   prominent   Chinese   social   media   platform.   Partici- pants were encouraged to share the survey link with their peers. Eligibility criteria included being above 18 years of age and enrolled as a medical undergraduate in a Chinese college. Participation   was   anonymous   and   voluntary,   and students had the right to withdraw at any stage. Com- pletion of all questions was required to submit the ques- tionnaire due to the settings of WJX. Informed consent was obtained from all participants, who subsequently received a summary report of their mental health status. Ethical approval for the study was granted by the ethics committee of the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University (JY20200326).  Measurements  The online questionnaire consisted of three sections. All questionnaires were administrated in Chinese. Section 1 comprised self-designed questionnaires to collect basic demographic information, such as monthly income, age, sex, grade, relationship status (single/partnered), and his- tory of psychiatric illness. Based on their grades, students were classified into preclinical (grades 1 to 3) and clini- cal students (grades 4 and 5). A trap question, “What is the Chinese national day?” was included to filter out inva- lid responses. Participants who answered this question incorrectly were excluded from the final analysis. Section   2 encompassed a series of well-established questionnaires to comprehensively measure the men- tal health of medical undergraduates. The Chinese ver- sion of the following questionnaires were administrated,

Our results also highlight a substantial positive asso- ciation between career choice regret and dropout inten- tion, consistent with prior findings [8, 32]. Both surveys in our study identified “intense competition,” “overwork,” and “long study period” as the most frequent reasons for this regret. These findings resonate with recent reports linking   prolonged   training   and   heavy   workload   with decreased willingness to pursue medical careers after graduation [9]. Another study also showed that 92% of the medical undergraduates complained that Chi- nese doctors suffered from tremendous workload [10]. Interestingly, previous studies in Chinese medical post- graduates and physicians produced consistent results [8, 33–36], which also demonstrated that low income and heavy workload greatly contributed to turnover inten- tion.   The   consistency   in   the   results,   across   different stages of medical training and career, underscores the pervasive nature of these challenges. There is a critical need for systemic interventions by policymakers, edu- cational institutions, and healthcare organizations, such as curricular reforms, workload regulations, and support measures to enhance well-being and job satisfaction. Another salient factor contributing to dropout inten- tion is the experience of workplace violence. Our find- ings corroborate previous research that frequent violence against healthcare workers significantly impacts medical students’ career choices and work intentions [37, 38]. Notably, one-tenth of the medical undergraduates expe- rienced workplace violence from parents or their families or visitors. Although existing studies have documented the high risk of violence victimization among Chinese healthcare workers [39–41], there is a surprising lack of attention to this issue among medical undergraduates. To our knowledge, only one study have investigated the incidence of workplace violence experience among 157 Chinese medical students, which found 30.6% of them experienced violence [42]. The lack of existing literature called for further studies to explore the specific nature, underlying causes, and the extent of workplace violence experienced by Chinese medical undergraduates. Hospi- tals should be aware of the risk of violence experienced by medical undergraduates and provide timely interven- tions, such as improving security measures and providing counseling and support for those affected by workplace violence. Our   model,   which   included   work-related   variables, demonstrated nice accuracy in predicting dropout inten- tions among preclinical students. Over the past decade, Chinese medical education has introduced “early con- tact with clinics” into its curriculum, offering preclini- cal students early clinical exposure [43]. Consequently, preclinical   students   might   experience   notable   work- related issues: in our study, 10.2% faced workplace vio- lence, 35.2% regretted their career choice, and 9.3% were dissatisfied with the Chinese healthcare environment. These negative experiences were linked to higher drop- out intentions. Our findings indicated that adverse work- related experiences might lead to attrition at the very early stages of medical education. Therefore, more atten- tion should be paid to these factors to improve retention rates and support the well-being of preclinical students. Our study possesses several notable strengths. First, to our knowledge, our study is the first to compre- hensively   evaluate   the   association   between   dropout  Fig.   3   ROC curves of   the   nomogram prediction model

This study utilizes a   nomogram technique to   develop a   predictive model for   dropout intention among   Chinese medical undergraduates based on   19 individual and   work ‑ related characteristics.  Method   A repeated cross ‑ sectional study was   conducted, enrolling 3536 medical undergraduates in   T1 (August 2020 ‑ April 2021) and   969 participants in   T2 (October 2022) through   snowball sampling. Demographics (age, sex, study phase, income, relationship status, history of   mental illness) and   mental health factors (including depres‑ sion, anxiety, stress, burnout, alcohol use disorder, sleepiness, quality of   life, fatigue, history of   suicidal attempts (SA), and   somatic symptoms), as   well as   work ‑ related variables (career choice regret and   reasons, workplace violence experience, and   overall satisfaction with   the   Chinese healthcare environment), were gathered via   questionnaires. Data from   T1 was   split into   a   training cohort and   an   internal validation cohort, while   T2 data served as   an   external valida‑ tion cohort. The nomogram’s performance was   evaluated for   discrimination, calibration, clinical applicability, and   gen‑ eralization using receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC), area under   the   curve (AUC), calibration curves, and   decision curve analysis (DCA).  Result   From 19 individual and   work ‑ related factors, five were identified as   significant predictors for   the   construc‑ tion of   the   nomogram: history of   SA, career choice regret, experience of   workplace violence, depressive symptoms, and   burnout. The AUC values for   the   training, internal validation, and   external validation cohorts were 0.762, 0.761, and   0.817, respectively. The nomogram demonstrated reliable prediction and   discrimination, with   adequate calibra‑ tion and   generalization across   both   the training and   validation cohorts.  Conclusion   This nomogram exhibits reasonable accuracy in   foreseeing dropout intentions among   Chinese medical undergraduates. It could guide colleges, hospitals, and   policymakers in   pinpointing students at   risk, thus informing targeted interventions. Addressing underlying factors such as   depressive symptoms, burnout, career choice regret, and   workplace violence may help reduce the   attrition of   medical undergraduates.

BMC Medical Education   (2024) 24:868  including the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depressive symptoms, the seven-item Gen- eralized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) for anxiety symptoms, the 20-item Learning Burnout Scale (LBS) for learning burnout, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) for sleepiness, the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) for high perceived stress, the 15-item Patient Health Ques- tionnaire (PHQ-15) for somatic symptoms, and the Alco- hol Use Disorders Identification Test Concise (AUDIT-C) for alcohol abuse/dependence. All of these scales demon- strated excellent reliability and validity and were widely used in the Chinese context [20–26]. The cutoff points and Cronbach’s alpha for each questionnaire in the two surveys are presented in Table 1. In addition to these mental distress measurements, a standardized linear analog was adopted to assess the quality of life (QOL) and fatigue. Participants were asked to rate their quality of life and fatigue within the past week on a standardized linear analog scale, with scores ranging from 0 (representing the poorest possible QOL/ fatigue) to 10 (indicating the highest possible QOL/ fatigue) [27]. Following our previous study [8], we opera- tionalized low QOL and high fatigue as scores equal to or exceeding a threshold of 0.5 standard deviations below the mean score. We also included a single question to capture lifetime suicidal attempts (SA). In T1, a yes or no question was used (“Have you ever attempted to kill yourself during your lifetime?). Those who affirmatively responded to this question were considered as having SA. This single item has been widely used in epidemiological surveys [28]. In T2, we used the first item of the Suicidal Behav- iors Questionnaire-Revised. Participants who chose “I have attempted to kill myself but did not want to die” and “I have attempted to kill myself, and really hoped to die” were identified as having SA. In Section   3, we evaluated dropout intention and several work-related variables, including career choice regret, experience of workplace violence, and overall satisfaction   with   the   Chinese   medical   environment. Following a previous study [8], participants were first asked if they had contemplated leaving medical school or shifting to a non-medical major within the last year. A positive response classified them as having dropout intention. The seriousness of this intention was further assessed using a five-point Likert scale, ranging from “not serious” to “extremely serious.” We assessed career choice regret via two items. All medical students were questioned if they have regret- ted medicine learning within the last year. We further questioned   them   about   the   reason   for   their   career choice regret using a multiple-choice question. The options in T1 included “low income,” “poor doctor- patient relationships,” “long study period,” “overwork,” “intense competition,” “experience of violence,” “high expectations of patients,” and “other causes.” [8]. In T2, we additionally added several options including “high research   pressure”,   “high   graduation   pressure”,   “too many shifts during holidays”, “low respect from the society”, “high pressure from standardized training”, and “few career development opportunities” based on the comments received in T1. The workplace violence was measured with a single question:   “Have   you   experienced   workplace   violence inflicted by patients or their family members/visitors?” The   options   included   “No   experience,”   “Experiencing verbal violence,” “Experiencing physical violence,” and “Experiencing both verbal and physical violence.” We binarized this variable into “with violence” and “without violence” for the subsequent analysis. We used a 5-point Likert scale to evaluate medical stu- dents’ overall satisfaction with the Chinese healthcare environment. The scores ranged from 1 (very dissatisfied) to 5 (very satisfied). We categorized those who reported dissatisfaction or very dissatisfaction with the Chinese medical environment into the non-satisfaction group.

BMC Medical Education   (2024) 24:868  Statistical analysis  All statistical analyses were performed using the R software (version 4.2.2), along with MSTATA software (www. mstata. com). The data from phase T1 was ran- domly partitioned into training and internal validation cohorts at a ratio of 7:3, with the data from phase T2 serving as an external validation cohort. The training cohort was deployed to identify potential predictors and construct the model, while the internal and exter- nal validation cohorts were utilized to evaluate its per- formance. Continuous data were presented as median and quartiles and categorized variables were displayed as frequency and percentage. Chi-square tests or rank- sum tests were employed to determine the factors asso- ciated with dropout intention. Tests were two-tailed, with   p   below 0.05 suggesting statistical significance. In the training cohort, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis was used for multivariate analysis to screen the independent risk factors. Factors displaying statistically significant association with dropout intention in the univariate analysis were included in the LASSO regression model. The most regularized and parsimonious model, with a tenfold cross-validated error within one standard error of the minimum, was selected. The selected factors in LASSO regression were then included in the multivari- ate logistic regression model using the enter method to build the model and nomogram. We   tested   the   performance   of   the   nomogram   in the training and validation cohort. We performed the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and cal- culated the area under the ROC curve (AUC) values. An AUC value greater than 0.7 indicated reasonable discrimination ability [29]. We evaluate the model’s calibration with a calibration curve plot created using a 1000-bootstrap resampling procedure. Additionally, we conducted a decision curve analysis (DCA) to deter- mine the net benefit threshold of prediction. Addition- ally, we performed separate ROC and AUC analyses for preclinical and clinical students to assess the model’s performance.  Result  Sample characteristics  In the first survey (T1), a cohort of 3,648 undergradu- ates was recruited. Of these, 112 responses were deemed invalid due to failure in answering the trap question cor- rectly, yielding a valid sample size of 3,536 participants (effective rate:96.9%). In the second survey (T2), 1,002 undergraduates were recruited. Here, 33 responses were invalidated, culminating in a final sample size of 969 participants   (effective   rate:   96.7%).   The   demographic information and mental health status of the participants are summarized in Table 2. Of the 4505 medical undergraduates, approximately 37% ( n   =   1671) reported intentions to drop out. The inci- dence of various mental distress was as follows: depres- sive symptoms were identified in 18% of participants, anxiety symptoms in 9.1%, somatic symptoms in 28%, alcohol use disorder in 8.5%, sleepiness in 40%, high per- ceived stress in 28%, high fatigue in 25%, low QOL in 21%, and burnout in 37%. Additionally, a small propor- tion reported a history of SA (9.8%) and previous diag- nosis of mental disorder (3.2%). About one-tenth of the participants reported victimization of workplace violence and expressed dissatisfaction with the Chinese healthcare environment. Career choice regret was expressed by 37% of the par- ticipants. The most frequently reported reasons for this regret during T1 included “overwork” ( n   =   881), “long study period” ( n   =   731), “intense competition” ( n   =   705), “poor doctor-patient relationship” ( n   =   694), and “high risk of violence victimization” ( n   =   694). In the subse- quent T2 survey, the prevalent complaints shifted to “intense   competition”   ( n   =   253),   “overwork”   ( n   =   238), “long study period” ( n   =   203), “low income” ( n   =   178), “high graduation pressure” ( n   =   163), and “poor doctor- patient relationship” ( n   =   161).  Variable selection and prediction model establishment  Table 3 compared the demographic information, men- tal health, and work-related variables between partici- pants with and without dropout intention in the training cohort. Dropout groups were more likely to be clinical undergraduates and female. They reported much higher risk of mental distress, including depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, somatic symptoms, high perceived stress, burnout, sleepiness, high fatigue, and low QOL. They were also more likely to report history of lifetime SA and mental illness. However, no significant differ- ence was found in alcohol use disorder between the two groups. In addition, participants with dropout intention were more likely to be victims of workplace violence, report career choice regret, and were more dissatisfied with the Chinese medical environment. The original model included fifteen candidate predic- tors: history of SA, career choice regret, experience of workplace violence, dissatisfaction with the healthcare environment, history of mental illness, depressive symp- toms, anxiety symptoms, sleepiness, high stress, high fatigue, low QOL, burnout, study phase, sex, and somatic symptoms. Utilizing the LASSO regression analysis, this was reduced to seven potential predictors in the training cohort (Fig. 1). The final multivariate logistic regression model for dropout intention encompassed these seven

We found that 37% of the medical undergraduates reported dropout intention within the last year. The results were consistent with a recent study conducted by Yu et al., which also found that one-third of the medi- cal undergraduates hoped to attrition from medicine [9]. The prevalence of dropout intention was lower than our previous findings in Chinese medical postgraduates (58%) using the same questionnaire [8]. Possible expla- nations could include differences in workload, expecta- tions, mentoring support, and professional development opportunities between undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Consistent with prior studies [14, 15, 30], our results demonstrated substantial association between dropout intention and mental health problems. Notably, burnout and depressive symptoms emerged as the independent predicting factors for dropout intention. This finding was in line with much of the previous literature on the posi- tive association between burnout, depressive symptoms, and attrition of healthcare workers and students [13, 14, 31]. Burnout and depressive symptoms were highly prevalent and distressful, affecting around two-fifth of the global medical students [30]. Notably, our study dem- onstrated a relatively stable prevalence of burnout and depression in both study period (2020 and 2022). This finding could possibly reflect a persistent mental health challenge in Chinese medical students rather than a short-term response to the pandemic. Hence, the results warrant a more profound investigation into the causes that contribute to the enduring nature of these mental problems. Furthermore, our study identified a history of suicidal attempts as another independent factor associated with dropout intention. Despite both suicidality and dropout being viewed as severe negative outcomes for medical students, scant research has explored their connection. This gap emphasizes the need for further study and  Table   4   Logistic regression model for dropout intention  a   OR   Odds Ratio,   CI   Confidence Interval  Characteristic   N   Event   N   OR   a   95% CI a   p -value Lifetime suicidal attempts  Without   2,205   824   —   —  With   270   160   1.63   1.21, 2.20   0.001  Career choice regret  Without   1,565   367   —   —  With   910   617   5.53   4.58, 6.69   <   0.001  Violence experience  Without   2,174   819   —   —  With   301   165   1.51   1.14, 1.99   0.004  Depressive symptoms  Without   2,028   712   —   —  With   447   272   1.36   1.04, 1.79   0.027  Burnout  Without   1,517   457   —   —  With   958   527   1.50   1.22, 1.83   <   0.001  Fig.   2   Nomogram prediction model for   dropout intention

This finding highlights the need for long- term   monitoring   and   intervention   for   mental   health problems in this population. Our findings could inform colleges, hospitals, and policymakers, enabling timely policy adjustments to reduce attrition rates among medi- cal students. Specifically, interventions addressing heavy workload, extended training periods, low income, and violence against healthcare workers and students may be beneficial. Several limitations should be recognized. First, the cross-sectional design constrains our ability to establish a causal relationship. Second, our sample was unbal- anced, predominantly consisting of preclinical students at the early stage of medical training. This imbalance likely   resulted   from   convenience   sampling,   as   clini- cal students were busier with graduation and clinical work. The higher proportion of early-year students may have led to an underestimation of dropout intention in our sample. In contrast, our recent study of medical postgraduates found a much higher dropout intention (about 58%), indicating the potential influence of train- ing stage on dropout intention of medical students [8]. While our models showed similar accuracy in identify- ing dropout intention in both preclinical and clinical students, studies with larger and more-balanced sam- ples are needed to further assess prevalence and asso- ciated factors for dropout intention and to validate our prediction models. A third limitation pertains to the data collection for the initial survey, which occurred in the year following the pandemic. During this period, students experienced college lockdowns and a shift to online learning, potentially impacting dropout inten- tions. However, the validation of our model in a sub- sequent independent survey conducted two years later indicates a reasonable generalizability of our findings. Finally,   while   previous   studies   have   established   the substantial association between dropout intention and actual dropout [6, 7], assessing the incidence and risk factors for actual dropout might provide a better insight into the attrition of medical students.  Conclusion  In conclusion, our study developed a predictive nomo- gram for dropout intention among medical undergrad- uates, integrating five key factors: history of suicidal attempts, depressive symptoms, burnout, career choice regret, and workplace violence experience. This nomo- gram has demonstrated strong internal and external vali- dation, performing well in terms of both discrimination and calibration. It could help identify medical undergrad- uates more likely to dropout, and provides a foundation for targeted interventions to support their retention.

BMC Medical Education   (2024) 24:868  predictors: history of SA, career choice regret, violence experience, depressive symptoms, high perceived stress, low QOL, and learning burnout. Five predictors were independently associated with dropout intention in the final model: history of SA, career   choice   regret,   workplace   violence   experience, depressive symptoms, and learning burnout (Table 4). This final logistic model was synthesized into a user- friendly nomogram, illustrated in Fig. 2. The total risk score represents a continuum, with higher scores indicat- ing a greater likelihood of dropout intention. As an illus- trative example, a medical undergraduate with no history of suicidal attempts or depressive symptoms, but who experienced workplace violence, learning burnout, and reported career choice regret, would obtain a score of approximately 153 (0   +   0   +   25   +   28   +   100). This would cor- respond to an estimated probability of dropout intention of roughly 75%.  Model performance evaluation  The AUC values of the nomogram model were 0.762 in the training cohort, 0.761 in the internal test cohort, and 0.817 in the external test cohort, which suggested reasonable accuracy of our model (Fig. 3). The calibra- tion and DCA curves of the nomogram were presented in Figs. 4 and 5. The calibration plots demonstrate a good correlation between the observed and predicted dropout intention. The results showed that the original nomogram was still valid for use in the validation sets, and the calibration curve of this model was relatively close to the ideal curve, which indicates that the pre- dicted results were consistent with the actual findings. The DCA curves suggested satisfactory clinical useful- ness of our model to screen for students with drop- out intention. The subgroup analysis revealed that the model exhibited nice accuracy among both preclini- cal and clinical students. For preclinical students, the AUC values were 0.763 in the training cohort, 0.758 in the internal cohort, and 0.831 in the external cohort. Among clinical students, the AUC values were 0.760 in the training cohort, 0.793 in the internal cohort, and 0.799 in the external cohort.
