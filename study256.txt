MATURE VS YOUNG WORKING  STUDENTS:  SIMILARITIES, DIFFERENCES,  AND DRIVERS OF GRADUATION  AND DROPOUT  PEDRO CARREIR A,  ANA SOFIA LOPES  Abstract  The high dropout rate among working students in higher education in Portugal, including both those who are  older and at a mature stage in their professional careers and those who are young and recent workers, is one  of the main concerns of educational policy. Identifying the drivers of the academic pathway for these students  is essential to promote successful education and increase labour productivity and business competitiveness.  Using an extensive longitudinal database of personal, course, and employment variables of 1,561 working  students from a Portuguese higher education institution, we perform a duration analysis to determine and  compare the factors that drive the dropout and graduation risks of mature and young working students in  higher education. The results show that, in general, young working students are more positively influenced by  financial aid, their motivation for the course, and the desire to find a new qualified professional career, while  mature working students depend more on social and academic integration. The accumulation of knowledge/  skills in the ‘out of class’ experience seems to contribute positively to academic performance.

74   PEDRO CARREIRA, ANA SOFIA LOPES  Introduction  The skills acquired during enrolment in higher education (HE) are predicted  to result in higher labour productivity, thus increasing the competitiveness  of business and allowing higher wages and global wealth (human capital  theory, e.g. Becker, 1962). Additionally, graduated individuals are known  to have a lower risk of unemployment and poverty, and a higher chance of  being successful entrepreneurs. Moreover, the benefits of HE to individuals  and society extend well beyond the economic sphere. Indeed, several non-  economic benefits of HE are mentioned by Perna (2005), such as improvements  in cognitive learning, emotional and moral development, and perceptions  of citizenship, family life, consumer behaviour, leisure, and health at an  individual level, and in increases in voting rates, charitable giving, blood  donations, volunteer work, and adult literacy at a social level.  Considering these benefits, governmental efforts have been made to widen  access to HE in Portugal, which resulted in a massive expansion of HE in the  late 20th century (Heitor & Horta, 2014), with the total number of students  growing from around 30,000 in 1960 to a peak of 400,000 in 2003. Moreover,  from 2003 onwards, this number remained steadily between 350,000 and  400,000 despite the unfavourable demographics of the country (the population  between 15 and 24 years old diminished by around 250,000 individuals  in the same period). This is not only a consequence of the implementation  of the Bologna process in 2006 and of the increase in direct social support  by the government, but also from the Lisbon Strategy and its guidelines, aimed  at increasing the presence of non-traditional students (NTSs) in HE and at  promoting lifelong learning in the European Union (EU) countries, which  have been followed in Portugal. Evidence of this includes the   Maiores de 23  (M23) admission regime, which is exclusively for students who are 23 or more  years of age and does not require the completion of secondary school,  which can be replaced by a qualifier exam on the scientific field of the HE  course, and the recent facilitation of access to HE of students from vocational  education, including the creation of vocational tertiary courses.  Regardless of the effort to promote the participation of NTSs in HE,  which has been successfully accomplished both in the EU and in Portugal,  educational policies that consider the specific needs and circumstances of  these students while aiming at stimulating their academic performance are  lacking; this contributes to the higher dropout rates of NTSs in comparison  to traditional students. Using a five-year longitudinal sample of both traditional  and non-traditional (working) students from a Portuguese HE institution  (HEI), Carreira and Lopes (2019) found a dropout rate of 42% for NTSs  and of 27% for traditional students. A study by Engrácia and Baptista (2018)  including the full population of new enrolments in HE undergraduate courses

75 MATURE VS YOUNG WORKING STUDENTS: SIMILARITIES, DIFFERENCES ...  in Portugal in the 2011/12 academic year estimated a dropout rate of 50%  among M23 students, well above the overall estimated dropout rate of 29%.  This justifies the call for studies focusing on identifying the particularities  of NTSs and on understanding the factors that explain their academic  performance in HE, specifically their graduation chances and risk of dropout,  that can be the basis for the development of specific and effective educational  policies targeting them.  Several definitions of NTSs can be found in the literature. According to  Gilardi and Guglielmetti (2011), Schuetze and Slowey (2002), and Schuetze  (2014), the definitions typically include one or more of the following: students  who enrol in HE only after some years have passed since graduation from  secondary school, older students, students representing minorities (e.g. due  to ethnicity, a deprived socioeconomic background and/or to being first-  -generation students), part-time students, married students, students with  dependents, students without a secondary school diploma, and students who  combine school with a professional activity (working students). In this study,  we focus on working students as one of the most important groups of NTSs.  Working students are quite different from traditional students. They have  less time available to study given their professional responsibilities and  they must handle potential work-study conflicts. On the other hand, the fact  that they can acquire soft skills in their jobs, such as communication and  time management skills, can assist them in improving their school performance.  The research on the factors that explain dropout behaviour in HE has  been very intense over the last decades and can be divided into three main  groups: studies that do not distinguish among different types of students,  studies that distinguish and compare traditional and NTSs, and studies that  focus on NTSs. Regarding the studies that treat all students in pooled samples,  the most established drivers of dropout are low academic performance/grades  (Metzner & Bean, 1987), low academic and social integration (Tinto, 1975,  1988, 1993), low performance in high school (Bean, 1980; DesJardins et al.,  1999; Murtaugh et al., 1999), employment (Gilardi & Guglielmetti, 2011;  Vickers et al., 2003), field of study ( Johnes & McNabb, 2004; Vickers et al.,  2003), being a first-generation student/parents’ education level (Ishitani, 2003;  Stratton et al., 2008), marital status ( Johnes & McNabb, 2004; Stratton et al.,  2008), and nationality (Arias Ortiz & Dehon, 2013).  On the literature that directly compares traditional and NTSs in terms of  predictors of dropout, Sorey and Duggan (2008) considered non-traditional  students to be those aged 25 or older (mature students) and found that  academic performance is of particular importance for young students,  while for adult students the key factors are social integration, institutional  commitment, degree utility, and finances. Gilardi and Guglielmetti (2011)  and Carreira and Lopes (2019) investigated the differences between working

Page 4:
76  and non-working students and found that social integration and academic/  learning assistance during the first year of enrolment (or even during pre-  enrolment) are of increased importance for working students, and that  financial support and institutional orientation regarding the match between  student interests or abilities and their courses have more impact on reducing  the dropout rate among non-working students.  Finally, a growing wave of studies focus on NTSs. Park and Choi (2009)  identified low organisational support and low relevance of the course for the  student as the main predictors of dropout among mature students; Venegas-  Muggli (2020) found that students who are parents, have a job, are not the  heads of their households, are enrolled in longer programmes, and who  attended adult high school have a higher risk of dropping out. For Portugal,  Lopes and Carreira (2018) concluded that dropout behaviour and/or graduation  achievement of working students are influenced by the motivation for the  course, family educational background (in contrast to the direction generally  observed for traditional students), professional background, social integration,  and peer effects. Santos et al. (2016), focusing on explaining grades and not  precisely on dropout behaviour, observed that the academic performance  of M23 students seems to increase with age and to vary significantly across  fields of study.  Although very rich, the literature has yet to explore the high heterogeneity  within NTSs, particularly among working students. Indeed, some of them  are relatively young, at the beginning of their active lives, and may have  decided to start working only as a way to finance their studies. Their jobs are  often part-time, unqualified, and unrelated to the academic course in which  they are enrolled, as they are probably investing in school to find a new,  permanent, and rewarding professional career, sometimes driven by social  or family pressures. At the other extreme, working students may also be older  individuals and mature professionals who have already built a strong portfolio  of skills and experience while facing, at the same time, greater household  responsibilities, as they have to afford their own homes and are married and  parents more often. They can be labelled as ‘delayed entrants’ (Souto-Otero  & Whitworth, 2017), as they have interrupted their normal academic  progression earlier in their lives, often due to financial constraints, and return  to HE only after several years. Even though they may also be in pursuit of  professional transformation, these students are more likely to enrol in HE  for motives related to professional pressure or progression within their current  professional careers, particularly when tertiary academic qualifications are  required, with the desire to complement their formation in some specific  areas of knowledge, or for pure self-satisfaction only. It is thus reasonable to  expect that the determinants of the academic path of mature working students  differ from those of young working students. The analysis of the similarities  PEDRO CARREIRA, ANA SOFIA LOPES

Page 5:
77  and differences between these two types of working students, including  the identification and comparison of the main determinants of their academic  paths, forms the main purpose of the present study and constitutes our first  contribution to the literature.  Additionally, the majority of previous studies have focused only on dropout  risk, thus neglecting the competing risk of graduation, which can have distinct  determinants (Arias Ortiz & Dehon, 2013; Lopes & Carreira, 2018; Scott  & Kennedy, 2005). In this article we address this gap by jointly estimating  the risks of graduation and dropout. We do it by executing a duration analysis,  under competing risks, on a longitudinal dataset on the working students of  a Portuguese HEI, containing information on several personal, course and  employment characteristics, that was built by combining four different data  sources. Moreover, the richness of the information contained in our database  allows dropout and graduation risks to be explained based on effective causes  and not on factors that may be understood as symptoms. For example, instead  of using poor academic performance as a potential factor for dropout, we use  underlying factors that may explain it. Moreover, the field of study is used to  control for the heterogeneity in the demands of courses from different  scientific fields but not as a proxy for students’ motivation and appropriate  choice of the course. Instead, we use a variable that directly measures such  motivation. Finally, based on the results, we develop policy recommendations,  both at a central level (government) and at a local level (HEI).  Even though the article is planned to be essentially of an exploratory  nature, inspired by the literature review, we formulate the following four  research hypotheses to guide the analysis and impose a structured flow on  the discussion of the results:  Hypothesis H1 (effect of financial support): social financial support is more important  in reducing the dropout risk for young working students than for mature working students,  as the latter benefit from higher financial independence.  Hypothesis H2 (effect of motivation for the course): a higher motivation for the course  is more important in increasing graduation prospects and reducing dropout risk for young  working students than for mature working students, as the latter have more established  jobs and do not seek such strong professional transformation.  Hypothesis H3 (effect of teaching methodolog y): e-learning teaching methodologies,  typically associated with a high dropout risk, may have a countervailing effect in the case  of mature working students and contribute to their academic success, as they facilitate the  work-study-family balance and these students are more often married and parents than  their younger counterparts.  Hypothesis H4 (effect of social integration): improved social integration, as a contributor  to the academic success of working students, is more important for mature working students  than for young working students, as the latter benefit from a natural integration with  traditional students due to age proximity.

78  The structure of the article is as follows. The next section describes the  methodology, including the process of data collection and preparation,  and the econometric modelling. Afterwards, in the results section, selected  descriptive statistics are presented and discussed, highlighting the main  similarities and differences between mature and young working students,  followed by the analysis of the estimations of the model. Finally, some  concluding remarks and policy recommendations are made.  Methodology  Dataset  In this study, we use an internal data source (SAD-BI,   Sistemas de Apoio à  Decisão   - Business Intelligence) from Politechnic of Leiria, a HEI that is  representative of the average Portuguese HE system in several aspects:  number of students; quantity and quality of the academic qualifications and  research of the teaching staff; number and diversity of study programmes  offered; involvement with the surrounding society; and overall reputation.  The SAD-BI database, which contains personal and background information  at the student level, was then combined with three additional data sources:  1) the   Inquérito Caixa Geral de Depósitos   (ICGD), which is imposed by the school  at the time of initial admission to all working students and provides information  on several characteristics of the jobs held by the students; 2) the Iberinform  Insight View online platform, which allowed us to obtain information on the  dimension and business sector of the organisations employing the students  in our sample; 3) the databases of   Direção-Geral de Estatística da Educação  e Ciência   (Ministry of Education and Science, Portugal), for information on  the course in which the student is enrolled. A description of the exact variables  used in the study is given in Table 1.  The study comprises all working students that were enrolled in an  undergraduate course of the Politechnic of Leiria in the academic years  2008/09 or 2009/10. These students were then observed until the end of  academic year 2016/17 (i.e. for eight and nine years) and divided in two  groups according to their age at initial enrolment: group 1 is composed of  the 1039 working students aged over 25 (adult or mature working students  subsample), and group 2 is composed of the 522 working students aged  25 years or less at admission (young working students subsample).  Regarding the age cutoff point, there is no consensus in the literature  on education economics: 20 (Park & Choi, 2009), 23 (Santos et al., 2016) and  25 years old (e.g. Jinkens, 2009; Metzner & Bean, 1987) are some of the main  alternatives. We chose 25 as the age cutoff point so as to follow the mainstream  literature and address the objectives of the article. Indeed, choosing a cutoff  PEDRO CARREIRA, ANA SOFIA LOPES

Page 7:
79  point younger than 25 would imply excessively unbalanced subsamples (the  young working students subsample would contain a proportion of students  lower than 30%). Moreover, requiring an age above 25 at initial admission is  sufficient to capture the ‘delayed entrants’, i.e. those working students who  are more likely to have interrupted their normal academic progression earlier  in their lives, who have already built some experience in the labour market  and whose return to school is more likely to be explained by motives related  to progression and/or skills development within their current professional  activity, and less likely by the desire to find a new professional career.  As SAD-BI implies a mandatory record for all students in each enrolment  year and students are traceable by an identification number, we organised the  data in a person-period dataset, with a total of 4,730 observations, where each  observation corresponds to a record for each time period in which the  individual is at risk of an event (DesJardins et al., 1999), so that duration  analysis tools could be applied. The mandatory nature of SAD-BI in all years  of enrolment has the additional advantage of making the joint database  immune to sample attrition, i.e. a student leaves it only if he/she drops out  or graduates. Finally, while the available data allowed us to control for the  situations where students dropped out from one course but changed to another  one within the HEI and for the multiple enrolment cases in which students  leave one course but maintain enrolment in at least one course within the  HEI (in which cases they were still considered to be at risk, and not considered  effective dropouts), it was not possible to identify those students who moved  to another HEI. Hence, dropouts in the present article represent leaving the  HEI and not exactly leaving HE. However, given that working students in  Portugal are typically associated with reduced mobility between HEI (for  example, in our dataset, only 1.7% of students are transfers from other HEI)  we believe that HEI dropouts overestimate HE dropouts only marginally.  Model  The econometric model used to test the research hypotheses and investigate  how the academic path of the students (dropout and graduation probabilities,  relative to the baseline outcome of no event) is affected by their personal,  course and employment characteristics is based on a duration analysis  approach (also known as event history analysis), under competing risks and  a discrete time setting, as in Scott and Kennedy (2005) and Arias Ortiz and  Dehon (2013), that allows its estimation through a multinomial logistic  regression.  Following related literature, as the observation period is finite and the  ideal definition of dropout (permanent interruption) is not implementable,  we consider dropouts to be the cases when students interrupt their enrolment,  are not observed to resume their studies within the observation period, and  MATURE VS YOUNG WORKING STUDENTS: SIMILARITIES, DIFFERENCES ...

81  Results  Descriptive Statistics  Figure 1 displays the dropout hazard functions, corresponding to the evolution  of the probability of dropout occurring in year   t   conditional on the non-event  having occurred in each year before   t . Similar to the majority of related  literature (e.g. Arias Ortiz & Dehon, 2013; Lopes & Carreira, 2018), dropout  risk has a peak in year 1, decreases throughout the normal duration of the  degree (three years), and increases again afterwards. However, there are visible  differences between the two types of students. Mature working students  observe a higher dropout risk than young working students in the first two  years of enrolment, while the opposite holds in years three, four and five.  Figure 1  Dropout hazard functions  20.7% 13.9% 8.8% 11.5% 13.1% 16.9% 10.0%   9.8% 20.6% 13.3% 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 1st year   2nd year   3rd year   4th year   5th year Mature working students Young working students  Table 1 presents the descriptive statistics of the variables used in this study,  computed separately for each subsample of mature and young working  students (columns 1 and 2, respectively). First of all, it is interesting to note  that, within working students, and despite the different evolutions with time  observed in Figure 1, there is no significant difference between the global  dropout rates for mature and young students (40.9% and 41.4%, respectively).  Coherently, the completion rate is only slightly higher for mature working  students (49%) than for young ones (47%).  MATURE VS YOUNG WORKING STUDENTS: SIMILARITIES, DIFFERENCES ...

84  course, readmissions, transferences from other institutions and/or courses  – account for 38% of the mature working students and 29% of the young  working students in our data.  In Portugal, undergraduate courses can operate as daytime classes, after-  work classes or on an e-learning basis (with no presential classes). Even though  the majority of working students enrol in after-work courses, the proportion  of younger students who enrol in a daytime course – which may be a signal  of high flexibility of their professional agenda and/or, for example, that their  jobs are frequently part-time – is higher than that of mature students.  Furthermore, mature working students are observed to enrol in courses  with higher proportions of working students (facilitating their social integration)  and with slightly lower average final GPA within the course (which may imply  lower benefits from peer effects), as compared to the other subsample.  Regarding employment variables, and considering the subsample of mature  working students, 10% of them are self-employed, 60% have qualified jobs  and 27% are employed in the public administration sector. These proportions  decrease to 6%, 34% and 19%, respectively, when the young working students  subsample is considered. Regarding the size of the employer organisations,  there are more students employed in micro and in large businesses, which  can be explained by the facts that there is a huge majority of micro business  in Portugal and that large businesses employ significantly more workers than  the others.  The variable unrelated job is a dummy constructed by the authors signalling  students that choose a course from a scientific field with no relation at all  with their job. For example, a student enrolled in a marketing course working  as a carpenter was classified with a value of 1, while a student enrolled in the  same course but working on sales got a value of 0. There is clear evidence of  a higher percentage of students with unrelated jobs in the subsample of young  students (52%) than in the mature students subsample (30%), suggesting that  young working students are indeed driven by their motivation to find a new  (more rewarding) qualified career, while mature working students may be  motivated to study to acquire additional skills, or to be promoted, within  their current professional career.  Model estimation  The results of the regressions of the multinomial logistic model, estimated  separately for mature and young working students using Stata and Gretl, are  presented in Table 2. The fields of study, omitted from the table, were considered  in the regressions as control variables. Both regressions revealed a statistically  significant log-likelihood ratio and a high percentage of correct predictions.  Also, variance inflation factor (VIF) tests were conducted in each of the  regressions and confirmed the absence of multicollinearity problems.  PEDRO CARREIRA, ANA SOFIA LOPES

86  Considering the fifth year of enrolment as the residual category, we observe  that, in both subsamples, the coefficients of years 1 and 2 are negative and  statistically significant for the risk of graduation, reflecting the normal  duration of the course of three years. On dropout risk, even though without  strong evidence, the coefficients of the time dummies again suggest that,  in the first two years of enrolment, the risk of dropout is higher for mature  students than for young students.  On individual characteristics, we observe that female working students  have a lower probability of dropping out than males. Married mature working  students have higher chances of graduation than those who are single,  and marriage also seems to reduce the probability of male young working  students dropping out. Moreover, young working students from abroad are  estimated to have a higher probability of graduation than those born in  Portugal.  Support is found here for the use of scholarships as a policy instrument  to promote the academic achievement of students, as it increases the  probability of graduation in both subsamples as in Sorey and Duggan (2008)  for the case of mature students. However, its effectiveness seems to be higher  in the case of young working students, as it also helps reduce their dropout  rate, an effect that does not occur for mature working students. This finding  validates our research hypothesis H1.  On the motivation for the course, if young working students enrol in their  most preferred course (first option), their probability of dropping out is  reduced, which is not verified for mature working students. This evidence  supports hypothesis H2.  A variable that is subject to special attention by policy makers is the  admission regime. For young working students, the admission regime does  not seem to be very important for explaining dropout and graduation risks.  Only readmissions have a significant coefficient, indicating that readmitted  students do not persist as long in the course (they either graduate or drop out  more rapidly than the other young working students). This result is also  observed for mature working students. For the latter, those with some previous  experience in HE (readmissions, transferral, course changes and students  who already have a HE diploma) have a higher probability of graduation,  as compared to the baseline NARHE regime, which may be explained by  their higher academic integration.  On course characteristics, we first observe that working students enrolled  in courses with daytime classes have a lower risk of dropping out than those  attending after-work classes or enrolled in an e-learning course, which may  be associated with the higher time flexibility of those able to attend classes  during the day. That dropout rates are higher in e-learning courses for mature  working students is contrary to hypothesis H3, which is thus not validated,  PEDRO CARREIRA, ANA SOFIA LOPES

87  and can reveal their higher needs regarding social and academic integration,  as compared to young working students.  Second, for mature working students, dropout risk seems to decrease,  and graduation prospects to increase, when they are integrated in classes with  a high proportion of working students (effects that are not observed among  young working students), which confirms the importance of social integration  for them (Carreira & Lopes, 2019; Gilardi & Guglielmetti, 2011) and validates  research hypothesis H4.  Third, the results highlight the importance of having successful peers for  both young and mature working students, as higher averages of final GPA  within the course contribute to increased graduation chances for all students,  even when controlling for the field of study.  Concerning employment variables, we highlight that working in the public  administration sector reduces the probability of dropping out among  mature working students and increases the probability of graduation among  young ones. Also, working in a medium size organisation may contribute to  increased graduation prospects, as compared to working in a micro, small or  large organisation. Finally, in the case of mature working students, holding  a qualified job may decrease the probability of dropping out, while, for young  working students, enrolling in a course unrelated with their job seems to  increase the likelihood of achieving graduation, which is probably related  with the previously mentioned high motivation to invest in a new, qualified,  and more rewarding professional career (Lopes & Carreira, 2018). This last  result validates hypothesis H2 and confirms the importance of motivation  for young working students.  Discussion and conclusions  Working students have abnormally high dropout rates, which is explained  not only by their higher time constraints (they dedicate a significant amount  of time to their jobs, thus reducing the time available for school activities),  but also by the lack of specific educational policies directed to them, as current  policies are, in general, designed for traditional students. Considering the  widely recognised internal and external benefits of HE, with the additional  advantage of promoting a more rapid growth of labour productivity in the  case of working students (as there is a real-time transfer to the economy),  gaining a better understanding of the specific characteristics of these students  is of major importance. Moreover, due to the high heterogeneity of working  students, it is also important to distinguish between young working students  – for whom the time gap between the conclusion of secondary school and  the enrolment in HE is lower, and who, in most cases, have to deal with an  MATURE VS YOUNG WORKING STUDENTS: SIMILARITIES, DIFFERENCES ...

88  unfulfilling professional career (which makes then strongly motivated to  complete their course of study seeking a significant professional transformation,  with the possibility of finding a qualified new career) – and mature working  students – who postponed the continuation of their studies earlier in their  lives (sometimes because of financial constrains) and who have been in the  labour market for several years, with established and qualified professions,  and whose motivation to enrol in HE is likely to be related to promotion  and development of skills within their current job. This distinction, including  the identification of the key determinants of graduation and dropout for each  type of working students, was the objective of the present article.  The results confirmed the main differences between the two types of  working students. Relative to young working students, mature working  students are married more often, are less likely to receive social financial aid,  make more use of the M23 access regime to HE, and less use of the NARHE,  enrol more often in courses related with their jobs and in after-work or  e-learning classes, exercise more qualified professional functions, and work  more frequently in the public administration sector or as self-employed.  Concerning the determinants of graduation and dropout, the results  highlighted some similarities and some differences between the two groups  of students. On the similarities, for example, in both cases, men are more  likely to drop out than women, and, despite additional household responsibilities,  married students perform better in HE than unmarried students. Next,  being employed in the public administration sector seems to be a facilitator  of graduation for young working students and a preventive factor of dropout  among mature working students. There are also certain effects suggesting  that some policies benefit both mature and young working students, as the  awarding of scholarships (which aims to overcome the financial limitations  of students), and the scheduling of daytime classes for those who can attend  them. Regarding the latter, working students seem to have a lower risk of  dropping out when they have a job that allows more time flexibility to reconcile  work and study. Furthermore, in both subsamples, students benefit from the  presence of successful peers, as a higher average final GPA within the course  increases their probability of graduation.  On the differences in the determinants of the academic pathways, we  found that the academic success of mature working students is very dependent  on their academic and social integration, given that having previous experience  in HE and attending traditional classes (as opposed to e-learning), jointly  with other working students, increases their probability of graduation and/  or decreases their probability of dropout. Therefore, from a policy perspective,  it is important to manipulate policy instruments such as the composition of  the classrooms and the time schedule of the classes to facilitate the integration  and socialisation of these students, especially with other students facing  PEDRO CARREIRA, ANA SOFIA LOPES

89  similar difficulties in managing the work-school balance. And this is of special  value in the first year of enrolment, in which the risk of dropout is the highest  for these students.  On the other hand, for young working students, their motivation for the  course seems to be the key element for their academic success, as those who  enrol in their first option courses have a lower risk of dropping out, and those  who enrol in a course in an unfamiliar field of study with no relation to their  jobs have a higher probability of graduating. This last result is indeed very  interesting, as it suggests that young working students are more motivated  to study and committed to earn a HE diploma when in pursuit of professional  transformation. According to the human capital theory, by acquiring non-  job-specific education, these students may foresee more benefits resulting  from graduation than those working students investing in upgrading skills  within their current professions.  Also, the fact that mature working students with established jobs enrol  more often in courses related to their professions than young working  students signify that they may be only interested in developing specific skills  required for their jobs, and less interested in completing the entire course,  thus limiting their incentives to achieve graduation (which is also supported  by the evidence that those students with a previous HE diploma drop out  more). In these cases, introducing flexibility in the curricular structure and/  or offering shorter and simplified versions of the courses can help prevent  these students from dropping out.  Finally, and still on mature working students, the fact that those with  qualified jobs drop out less often than their counterparts reveals that the  accumulation of knowledge and skills in the ‘out of class’ experience  contributes positively to their performance in school as well.  To conclude, even though the results in the present study were obtained  using data from a Portuguese HEI, and interpreted under the Portuguese  context, we believe that they are extendable to other countries with similar  HE contexts, especially in the EU, where the suggested policy recommendations  may also be relevant and effective.

In contrast to young working students, mature working  students are more likely male (54%) and married (28% and 21% of male and  female mature working students, respectively, are married, as opposed to  homologous percentages of 5% and 7% in the case of young working students).  Regarding financial aid, 7% of young working students receive social financial  support whereas only 3% of mature working students are granted a scholarship.  Almost all mature working students enrol in their first option course and  in the first admission call, and with higher percentages than young working  students, even though the majority of the latter also enrol in the first option  and in the first call.  The main admission regime in Portugal, for young students, is the National  Access Regime to Higher Education (accounting for 55% of young working  students, as opposed to only 16% of mature working students). In contrast,  the M23 admission regime is the most frequent among mature working  students (accounting for 46% of them, as opposed to only 16% of young  working students). Combined, the other five admission regimes at the  undergraduate level in Portugal – graduation from a technological specialisation  course in a related field of study, graduation in a different tertiary undergraduate  MATURE VS YOUNG WORKING STUDENTS: SIMILARITIES, DIFFERENCES ...

80  the interruption period is of at least three years. Given the adopted definition,  dropout behaviour can occur at the latest in year 5 for the students observed  only for eight years. Hence, the database was restricted to the first five years  of enrolment of students, implying a reduction from the initial 4,730 to 4,420  total person-period observations but assuring that all events of interest are  observed in all years in an unbiased way.  The hazard of event k (k = 1,2, with 1 representing the graduation event  and 2 representing the event of dropout) for individual i (i = 1,...,1039 or  i = 1,...,522, if i is a mature working student or a young working student,  respectively) at time t (t = 1,...,5) is thus:  (1)  where D i1 ,...,D i5   are time period dummy variables identifying each year  (D i1   = 1 if the observation for individual i comes from the first year of  enrolment, and D i1   = 0 if it comes from any other year) and the intercept  parameters α k1 ,...,α k5   capture the hazard probabilities when the value of all  covariates is zero in each year. X it   is the vector of covariates, including the  information on personal characteristics, educational background, course  characteristics, peer characteristics and job characteristics of student i in  period t. Finally, β j   (β k ) is the vector of parameters measuring the effect of  the covariates on outcome j(k), on a logit scale.  The hazard of the no-event h i (0,t) is defined as, given by:  (2)  Hence, the ratio, usually referred to as the outcome-specific hazard ratio  that measures the risk of experiencing event k relative to the risk of observing  no event (the reference category in our multinomial logit model), can be  computed as:  (3)  Finally, taking logistic transformations on both sides of equation (3), we  obtain:  (4)  It is now visible that the covariates are linearly related with the logistic  transformation of the hazard ratio and not directly with the hazard probabilities.  This is the equation to be estimated in the next section.  ℎ 𝑖𝑖   (𝑘𝑘, 𝑡𝑡) =   𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒[(𝛼𝛼 𝑘𝑘1   𝐷𝐷   𝑖𝑖1   +⋯+𝛼𝛼 𝑘𝑘5   𝐷𝐷   𝑖𝑖5   )+(𝛽𝛽 𝑘𝑘   𝑋𝑋   𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   )] 1+∑   𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒[(𝛼𝛼 𝑗𝑗1   𝐷𝐷   𝑖𝑖1   +⋯+𝛼𝛼 𝑗𝑗5   𝐷𝐷   𝑖𝑖5   )+(𝛽𝛽 𝑗𝑗   𝑋𝑋   𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   )] 2 𝑗𝑗=1  ℎ 𝑖𝑖   (0, 𝑡𝑡) =   1 1+∑   𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒[(𝛼𝛼 𝑗𝑗1   𝐷𝐷   𝑖𝑖1   +⋯+𝛼𝛼 𝑗𝑗5   𝐷𝐷   𝑖𝑖5   )+(𝛽𝛽 𝑗𝑗   𝑋𝑋   𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   )] 2 𝑗𝑗=1 .  ℎ 𝑖𝑖   (𝑘𝑘, 𝑡𝑡) ℎ 𝑖𝑖   (0, 𝑡𝑡) ⁄   = exp[(𝛼𝛼   𝑘𝑘1   𝐷𝐷 𝑖𝑖1   + ⋯ + 𝛼𝛼   𝑘𝑘5   𝐷𝐷 𝑖𝑖5   ) + (𝛽𝛽 𝑘𝑘   𝑋𝑋 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   )].  log [   ℎ 𝑖𝑖   (𝑘𝑘, 𝑖𝑖 ) ℎ 𝑖𝑖   (0, 𝑖𝑖 )   ] = (𝛼𝛼   𝑘𝑘1   𝐷𝐷 𝑖𝑖1   + ⋯ + 𝛼𝛼   𝑘𝑘5   𝐷𝐷 𝑖𝑖5   ) + (𝛽𝛽 𝑘𝑘   𝑋𝑋 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   ).  ℎ 𝑖𝑖   (𝑘𝑘, 𝑡𝑡) =   𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒[(𝛼𝛼 𝑘𝑘1   𝐷𝐷   𝑖𝑖1   +⋯+𝛼𝛼 𝑘𝑘5   𝐷𝐷   𝑖𝑖5   )+(𝛽𝛽 𝑘𝑘   𝑋𝑋   𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   )] 1+∑   𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒[(𝛼𝛼 𝑗𝑗1   𝐷𝐷   𝑖𝑖1   +⋯+𝛼𝛼 𝑗𝑗5   𝐷𝐷   𝑖𝑖5   )+(𝛽𝛽 𝑗𝑗   𝑋𝑋   𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   )] 2 𝑗𝑗=1  ℎ 𝑖𝑖   (0, 𝑡𝑡) =   1 1+∑   𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒[(𝛼𝛼 𝑗𝑗1   𝐷𝐷   𝑖𝑖1   +⋯+𝛼𝛼 𝑗𝑗5   𝐷𝐷   𝑖𝑖5   )+(𝛽𝛽 𝑗𝑗   𝑋𝑋   𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   )] 2 𝑗𝑗=1  .  ℎ 𝑖𝑖   (𝑘𝑘, 𝑡𝑡) ℎ 𝑖𝑖   (0, 𝑡𝑡) ⁄   = exp[(𝛼𝛼   𝑘𝑘1   𝐷𝐷 𝑖𝑖1   + ⋯ + 𝛼𝛼   𝑘𝑘5   𝐷𝐷 𝑖𝑖5   ) + (𝛽𝛽 𝑘𝑘   𝑋𝑋 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   )].  log [   ℎ 𝑖𝑖   (𝑘𝑘, 𝑖𝑖 ) ℎ 𝑖𝑖   (0, 𝑖𝑖 )   ] = (𝛼𝛼 𝑘𝑘1   𝐷𝐷 𝑖𝑖1   + ⋯ + 𝛼𝛼   𝑘𝑘5   𝐷𝐷 𝑖𝑖5   ) + (𝛽𝛽 𝑘𝑘   𝑋𝑋 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   ).  ℎ 𝑖𝑖   (𝑘𝑘, 𝑡𝑡) =   𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒[(𝛼𝛼 𝑘𝑘1   𝐷𝐷   𝑖𝑖1   +⋯+𝛼𝛼 𝑘𝑘5   𝐷𝐷   𝑖𝑖5   )+(𝛽𝛽 𝑘𝑘   𝑋𝑋   𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   )] 1+∑   𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒[(𝛼𝛼 𝑗𝑗1   𝐷𝐷   𝑖𝑖1   +⋯+𝛼𝛼 𝑗𝑗5   𝐷𝐷   𝑖𝑖5   )+(𝛽𝛽 𝑗𝑗   𝑋𝑋   𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   )] 2 𝑗𝑗=1  ℎ 𝑖𝑖   (0, 𝑡𝑡) =   1 1+∑   𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒[(𝛼𝛼 𝑗𝑗1   𝐷𝐷   𝑖𝑖1   +⋯+𝛼𝛼 𝑗𝑗5   𝐷𝐷   𝑖𝑖5   )+(𝛽𝛽 𝑗𝑗   𝑋𝑋   𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   )] 2 𝑗𝑗=1 .  ℎ 𝑖𝑖   (𝑘𝑘, 𝑡𝑡) ℎ 𝑖𝑖   (0, 𝑡𝑡) ⁄   = exp[(𝛼𝛼   𝑘𝑘1   𝐷𝐷 𝑖𝑖1   + ⋯ + 𝛼𝛼 𝑘𝑘5   𝐷𝐷 𝑖𝑖5   ) + (𝛽𝛽 𝑘𝑘   𝑋𝑋 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   )].  log [   ℎ 𝑖𝑖   (𝑘𝑘, 𝑖𝑖 ) ℎ 𝑖𝑖   (0, 𝑖𝑖 )   ] = (𝛼𝛼 𝑘𝑘1   𝐷𝐷 𝑖𝑖1   + ⋯ + 𝛼𝛼 𝑘𝑘5   𝐷𝐷 𝑖𝑖5   ) + (𝛽𝛽 𝑘𝑘   𝑋𝑋 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   ).  ℎ 𝑖𝑖   (𝑘𝑘, 𝑡𝑡) =   𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒[(𝛼𝛼 𝑘𝑘1   𝐷𝐷   𝑖𝑖1   +⋯+𝛼𝛼 𝑘𝑘5   𝐷𝐷   𝑖𝑖5   )+(𝛽𝛽 𝑘𝑘   𝑋𝑋   𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   )] 1+∑   𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒[(𝛼𝛼 𝑗𝑗1   𝐷𝐷   𝑖𝑖1   +⋯+𝛼𝛼 𝑗𝑗5   𝐷𝐷   𝑖𝑖5   )+(𝛽𝛽 𝑗𝑗   𝑋𝑋   𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   )] 2 𝑗𝑗=1  ℎ 𝑖𝑖   (0, 𝑡𝑡) =   1 1+∑   𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒[(𝛼𝛼 𝑗𝑗1   𝐷𝐷   𝑖𝑖1   +⋯+𝛼𝛼 𝑗𝑗5   𝐷𝐷   𝑖𝑖5   )+(𝛽𝛽 𝑗𝑗   𝑋𝑋   𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   )] 2 𝑗𝑗=1 .  ℎ 𝑖𝑖   (𝑘𝑘, 𝑡𝑡) ℎ 𝑖𝑖   (0, 𝑡𝑡) ⁄   = exp[(𝛼𝛼   𝑘𝑘1   𝐷𝐷 𝑖𝑖1   + ⋯ + 𝛼𝛼   𝑘𝑘5   𝐷𝐷 𝑖𝑖5   ) + (𝛽𝛽 𝑘𝑘   𝑋𝑋 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   )].  log [   ℎ 𝑖𝑖   (𝑘𝑘, 𝑖𝑖 ) ℎ 𝑖𝑖   (0, 𝑖𝑖 ) ] = (𝛼𝛼   𝑘𝑘1   𝐷𝐷 𝑖𝑖1   + ⋯ + 𝛼𝛼   𝑘𝑘5   𝐷𝐷 𝑖𝑖5   ) + (𝛽𝛽 𝑘𝑘   𝑋𝑋 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   ).
