One   of   the   possible   drivers   behind   this  gender gap in the labour market is the female dropout from STEM education.  The causes of the gender differences in the persistence of pursuing STEM  studies   have   been   explained   by   multiple   factors   related   to   interest   and  resolution in this type of career. The goal of the present research is to study  the Engineering persistence gender gap in higher education by exploring the  main factors underlying the leakage in the pipeline of Engineering fields. Our  study reports the results of 34 qualitative in-depth interviews where internal  barriers, stereotypes and external obstacles are assessed by women who  have left their university degrees, compared with men who have withdrawn  and women who have persisted. Results from the content analysis suggest  that the undermining of persistence in Engineering fields is related to factors  such as the chilly and hostile environment in classes or the workload from  an   excessively   demanding   curriculum.   Other   factors   affecting   women’s  withdrawal are the lack of role models and the perceived incongruity between  the female gender role and STEM roles in society, leading to a weakening  of female students’ self-efficacy and eroding their sense of belongingness,  even making them consider dropping out of their Engineering degree. These  findings provide information for the design of future STEM interventions aimed  to enhance women’s persistence in STEM university studies.  KEYWORDS  STEM, self-efficacy, belongingness, motivation, curriculum, gender stereotypes,  persistence  Introduction  The need for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) development  to increase and maintain our current quality of life is globally acknowledged. STEM fields  are the basis of our everyday lives, being responsible, for instance, for having clean water,  food to eat and life-saving medicines. However, most of these advances have historically  TYPE   Hypothesis and Theory  PUBLISHED   12 August 2022  DOI   10.3389/fpsyg.2022.918439  OPEN ACCESS  EDITED BY  Sergi Fàbregues,  Open University of Catalonia, Spain  REVIEWED BY  Kathryn Holmes,  Western Sydney University,  Australia  Katja Upadyaya,  University of Helsinki,  Finland  *CORRESPONDENCE  Susana González-Pérez  susana.gonzalezperez@ceu.es  SPECIALTY SECTION  This article was submitted to  Gender, Sex and Sexualities,  a section of the journal  Frontiers in Psychology  RECEIVED   12 April 2022  ACCEPTED   07 July 2022  PUBLISHED   12 August 2022  CITATION  González-Pérez S, Martínez-Martínez M,  Rey-Paredes V and Cifre E (2022) I  am done with this!

González-Pérez et al.   10.3389/fpsyg.2022.918439  Frontiers in   Psychology   04   frontiersin.org  these internalized values tend to drive female students away from  male-stereotypic   careers   perceived   lower   in   communion  ( Diekman et al., 2010 ), leading to horizontal segregation ( Eagly,  1987b ;   Wood and Eagly, 2012 ). Also, as proposed by Tinto’s  model, the (communal) goal congruity considers the temporal  dimension in three phases: (1) anticipate (in)congruity prior to  role decisions, (2) experienced (in)congruity in a particular role,  and (3) psychological and behavioral responses to maintain or  seek congruity ( Diekman et al., 2017 ). So, the socialization process  plays a key role, as societal gender stereotypes ( Bakan, 1966 ) lead  even young females ( Block et al., 2018 ) to internalize communal  values instead of agentic traits ( Eagly, 1987b ) which are not  congruent   with   the   expected   agentic   traits   associated   to  STEM. This anticipated goal incongruity may fuel the decision not  to prior enroll in a STEAM career. The second phase focuses on  what happens after individuals enter into social roles, i.e., STEM  majors. Beliefs about anticipated goal (in)congruity might be more  or less accurate with their actual experiences of goal (in)congruity.  Then, in phase 3, individuals respond to maintain/seek congruity.  To do so, they might change the motives (i.e., downplaying the  importance of the motive, such as communality) or roles (i.e.,  dropping out STEM majors).  Motivation: Self-efficacy perception  perspective  Among the other lower-order factors in Tinto’s model that  determine motivation, self-efficacy is especially important. Self-  efficacy is an aspect of social cognitive theory defined as “the  exercise of human agency through people’s beliefs in their  capabilities to produce desired effects by their actions” ( Bandura,  1997 ) or “judgments of how well one can execute courses of action  required to deal with prospective situations” ( Bandura, 1982 ).  In this line, prior schooling and preferences for school subjects  strongly influence whether women feel motivated to study STEM  at college ( Delaney and Devereux, 2019 ) based on their experience.  Self-efficacy has been shown to mediate perseverance, as students  who have higher self-efficacy are more likely to persist in the face  of difficulty ( Seymour and Hewitt, 1997 ;   Zimmerman, 2000 ;  Usher and Pajares, 2008 ). Regarding the sources of self-efficacy,  this could be built by mastery experience in the classroom, i.e., by  succeeding in a perceived to be very difficult exam or assignment  ( Usher and Pajares, 2008 ). Thus, the role of school subjects in later  STEM enrolment contributes to the gender gap in STEM in  college, making it critical to provide positive STEM experiences  in school to increase female students’ interest in STEM fields  ( Fervers et al., 2020 ). Skills and abilities also shape female students’  goals, motivating them to enroll in a STEM major, for example,  spatial skills ( Halpern et al., 2007 ) and perceptions of ability have  been found to predict career choices in Engineering ( Eccles and  Wigfield, 2002 ). Emotional or physiological states are also sources  of self-efficacy that students may feel when completing a difficult  task successfully ( Phan, 2012 ;   Phan and Ngu, 2016 ). Social  persuasion ( Bandura, 1997 ) is the external encouragement  received from peers or faculty members. Finally, vicarious  experience frequently occurs for students when one compares  oneself with another peer ( Bandura, 1997 ). In this line, sociologists  have   identified   the   so-called   occupational   inheritance  phenomenon ( Mannon and Schreuders, 2007 ), which shows that  female students entering Engineering are more likely than men to  have an engineer in the family, while those without engineers in  the family must find another figure to inspire and motivate them.  In sum, family, especially parents, are critical early socializers of  their children’s academic interests and their academic choices of  STEM majors ( Simpkins et al., 2006 ). Nevertheless, having the  possibility to interact with role models (such as an engineer in the  family or an inspiring science teacher) reduces the effect of gender  stereotypes and increases intentions of female students’ enrolment  in STEM majors ( González-Pérez et al., 2020 ). Also, intervention  FIGURE 1  The proposed theoretical model of gendered role congruity in students’ motivation and persistence in engineering.

González-Pérez et al.   10.3389/fpsyg.2022.918439  Frontiers in   Psychology   06   frontiersin.org  be necessary to incorporate as many real, everyday examples, as  possible to continue to encourage women students to stick with  challenging introductory classes ( Wang and Degol, 2013 ;   Kelly,  2016 ). In terms of the type of teaching methods, hands-on projects  are more meaningful and interesting for female students ( Mitchell,  1993 ;   Halpern, 2004 ;   Geist and King, 2008 ). Project-based  learning ( Blumenfeld et al., 2000 ) has proven to increase students’  engagement as well as a deeper understanding of scientific  problems ( Kaldaras et al., 2021 ). Instruction based on memorizing  without understanding has become obsolete. A better and deeper  understanding of science enables students to explain phenomena  and solve real-life problems, while engaging more female students  ( Wan, 2021 ). Collaborative projects and environments are  particularly helpful for female students ( Wang, 2012 ), as it can  provide them with real-world applications of science, reinforcing  their decision to persist ( Margolis et al., 2000 ). When faculties  embrace these real-life situation teaching techniques, female  students’ learning and confidence levels improve ( Hyde and Gess-  Newsome, 2000 ), nevertheless STEM majors have not yet fully  embraced these more collaborative teaching styles ( Laird et al.,  2007 ). However, it is noteworthy to remark that, contrary to  expected, recent studies (i.e.,   Sax et al., 2018 ) have found that  feeling supported by the computing department, as well as by  peers, results to be central to fostering women’s and minority  students’ sense of belonging in the field of computing, even more  than specific inclusive pedagogical practices.  The present study  While most of the existing studies addressing these topics have  been conducted using mostly quantitative methods ( Arriaga et al.,  2011 ;   Bernardo et al., 2017 ), there is a lack of qualitative research  providing in-depth analysis of the views of female drop-out students.  When so, although they present interesting research contributions,  they have some shortcomings. This is the case of the one of   Casanova  et al. (2021) ,   which is not focused on the attrition gender perspective.  Others such as   Chou and Chen (2015)   give an extensive vision of  current engineering female students’ perceptions, but without  pointing out the divergences between the ones who persist and the  ones who switch or drop out. Even   Madara and Cherotich (2016) ,  who studied the challenges that face female engineering students,  highlighted just the perspective provided by current students. The  present study aims to give voice to female dropout students to seek  the underlying reasons that lead them to leave their majors. Dropout  and   non-dropout   female   engineering   students   face   similar  challenges in male-dominated majors, however, there are triggers  that make them decide to switch, while others decide to stay.  Understanding how women who continue in engineering do differ  from those who leave could help us to find useful individual and  organizational tools for helping them to stay. On the other hand,  we aim to get a better understanding of how female students who  drop out feel that their sense of belonging and motivation to persist  was undermined in a male-dominated major. Therefore, we propose  the following research questions to be   answered by in-depth  interviews addressing the following research questions:  RQ1:   In what ways do women who drop out have different  goals that lead them to consider engineering majors to  be less aligned with female (communal) gender roles  than women who do not drop out or men who drop out?  RQ2:   What are the main differences found in terms of self-  efficacy perception between female and male students  who drop out?  RQ3:   In what ways does the sense of belongingness (chilly  climate) of students who drop out differ from that of  students who do not drop out?  RQ4:   In what way may the perception of the curriculum  (collaborative methods and grading system) affect  female motivation for persisting in Engineering?  RQ5:   In what ways does role congruity perception impact  female students’ attrition rates?  RQ6:   What types of interventions or measures could be taken  in order to better prevent female students from  abandoning their studies?  Methods  Procedure  We used a mixed-methods approach combining qualitative  and quantitative analyses. The overall purpose of mixed methods  studies is that the use of quantitative and qualitative approaches in  combination provides a better understanding of the research  problem than either approach alone ( Caracelli and Greene, 1993 ;  Creswell and Plano Clark, 2017 ). We applied qualitative analysis  to explore the ideas, behaviors, and feelings of student participants  and quantitative methods to determine the direction or extent of  these insights.   Greene (2011)   points out several advantages of  mixed methods research: complementarity (the results from one  method clarify the findings from the other method), development  (the results from one method help to develop the use of the other  method, for example, to inform future research) and expansion  (in our case, seeking to extend theories about the causes that  prevent women from dropping out from STEM degrees).  According to   Molina-Azorín (2016) ,   data collection refers to  the sequence the researcher uses to collect both quantitative and  qualitative data. In this research, we gathered the information at  the same time (concurrent design) which means that researchers  seek congruent findings. Thus, in the in-depth interviews,  we asked participants to quantify some nodes.  Sample  We performed a non-probability sampling method including  quota sampling and snowball sampling. In a quota sampling,

Page 7:
González-Pérez et al.   10.3389/fpsyg.2022.918439  Frontiers in   Psychology   07   frontiersin.org  researchers develop control categories, or quotas, of population  elements whereas, in a snowball sampling, participants are asked  to assist researchers in identifying other potential subjects  ( Malhotra, 2008 ).  In this study, we   conducted 34 in-depth interviews with  students participating (or that have participated) in an Engineering  major and we posed 3 quotas: 10 dropout male students; 10 dropout  female students, and 10 non dropout female students, however,  we   decided to extend the number of female non-dropout  participants to strengthen the recommendations to persist (RQ6).  Snowball sampling design was applied to identify potential subjects  in each quota. We initially contacted 5 women who were studying  for an Engineering degree and asked them to look for other women  persisting in Engineering or women or men who have abandoned  their Engineering studies. Looking for students who were willing to  participate in the research has not been an easy matter, especially  for women who drop out of engineering majors because, in most  cases, they have assumed it is a personal failure that they find  difficult to talk about. Therefore, we reached an agreement with the  Royal Academy of Engineering and ASTI Talent and Technology  Foundation, which helped us by providing the contact details of  women studying engineering. Finally, the sample consisted of 9  male dropout students, 10 female dropout students, and 15 female  non-dropout students. Participants were born between 1994 and  2003. All of them started an Engineering major and most of the  students who dropped out changed to majors in the social sciences  such as business administration, economics, business intelligence,  or international relationships. Participants’ characteristics are  reported in   Supplementary Table 1 .  Study design  The   research   team   designed   the   study   by   generating  hypotheses about possible causes and associated features that  prevent women from dropping out of STEM majors, based on the  theoretical model developed in the previous section. This led to  the design of a semi-structured interview ( Marshall and Rossman,  2014 ) to understand the factors that influence female students’  retention in engineering. Questions related to the persistence of  students in engineering degrees were developed based on previous  research on female students in STEM ( González-Pérez et al., 2020 ).  To ensure the objectivity of the interview process, the authors  carefully wrote and rewrote all the questions (consulting with  outside third-party colleagues) both to improve construct validity  and to ensure that the authors did not lead respondents in their  answers ( Gibbert and Ruigrok, 2010 ). A common set of questions  was presented to all participants in a semi-structured interview to  identify both positive and negative experiences that have occurred  over the course of the respondents’ academic life. Interviewers  established a climate of trust to ensure that respondents felt safe  in sharing their experiences. Thus, their experiences, rather than  the authors’ perspectives, drove the research.  Participants who agreed to participate in our study were  scheduled for an interview with a researcher. Given the sensitive  nature of the topics covered in our interviews, interviews began  with an explanation of the purpose of the research, a reiteration of  the assurance of confidentiality, and an opportunity to allow  respondents to ask any questions before starting. All interviews  were conducted online by Teams or similar apps. Online  interviews, in addition to saving time in commuting, have been  shown   to   produce   as   reliable   information   as   face-to-face  interviews and, in some cases, may even ease respondents’ anxiety  ( Salmons, 2015 ).  Each interview lasted half an hour on average, was recorded  by the interviewer, transcribed by the research team, and  completely anonymized. Data were collected from December 2021  to February 2022.  Measure  Transcriptions of all the interviews were entered into Nvivo  12 to organize and manage the data. Interview questions focused  on the following areas: motivations for choosing an Engineering  degree, course design and subjects they feel more comfortable  with, self-efficacy perception, belongingness, chilly climate with  classmates and/or teachers, and socio-economic status. Indirectly,  we looked for the factors underlying the women’s decision to leave  engineering degrees/majors, that contribute to the persistence of  gender inequalities in STEM fields. The interview guide, based on  the research questions and a review of the literature, included the  following general questions: (1) What motivations led you to  choose an engineering degree? (2) To what extent have you used  collaborative projects or with a practical approach? (3) Did  you feel at any time that you were not capable of getting an  engineering degree? (4) How do you think relationships with  peers and teachers influence the decision to persist? (5) Do  you   consider that socioeconomic status influences to study  engineering? Nodes include gender congruity, goals (attitude and  early experiences, role models, socio-economics status), self-  efficacy, sense of belongingness (chilly climate with classmates and  chilly   climate   with   teachers),   curriculum   perception,   and  persistence. Nodes are described in   Supplementary Table 2 .  To homogenize coding methods, four interviews were  randomly selected and independently analyzed by three authors  to identify the content representative in each node, as well as novel  themes. After coding, these three authors discussed the nodes and  paragraphs representing them and agreed on node labels and  definitions, developing a codebook that facilitated reliability  among raters. The remaining 30 transcripts were then coded  separately by two authors using the codebook and labelling  segments of text according to whether the content appeared to  pertain to one or more of the defined nodes.  The two coding authors then compared their individual  assessments. The reliability of the coding between the authors  resulted in 97.04% agreement. To test this interrater reliability,  we obtained the Cohen’s Kappa coefficient, resulting in 0.55. The  Kappa coefficient is a quantitative measure of reliability for coders

Page 8:
González-Pérez et al.   10.3389/fpsyg.2022.918439  Frontiers in   Psychology   08   frontiersin.org  rating the same phenomena, corrected for how often the raters  may agree by chance ( Cohen, 1960 ). As Cohen suggests, a Kappa  coefficient superior to 0.41 should be acceptable.  To meet the assurances on confidentiality given to participants,  the authors did not involve a third party in coding interviews.  According to the quantitative research, we used the Mann–  Whitney U test for independent samples (a non-parametric  alternative to paired   t -test) to rate differences in the mean values  between male and female students who have dropped out; and  between female students who persist and female students who  have dropped out.  For this purpose, in the interview, we asked participants  questions such as: (1) Do you think that men and women have  different motivations to choose a university degree? (2) Did  you feel more interested in subjects with a more practical content  or a more collaborative approach? (3) Have you felt that you had  a low self-efficacy perception? (4) Did you experience a chilly  climate with teachers and/or classmates? (5) To what extent do  you   consider   that   socioeconomic   status   is   a   barrier   to  studying engineering?  Participants answered to the questions using an 11-point  Likert scale, where 0 means that they totally disagree with the  question posed and 10 that they totally agree with it. For example,  in the question “have you felt that you had a low self-efficacy  perception?” a rating of 10 means that he/she agrees with this  negative self-view, whereas a rating of 0 refers to the opposite,  showing a positive self-concept to finish his/her STEM degrees.  Previous scholars have used an 11-point Likert scale to measure  these issues ( Nicolaidou and Philippou, 2003 ;   Mohd Dzin and Lay,  2021 ;   Hitches et al., 2022 ) whereas other researchers state that the  reliability of scales increases with the number of points used  ( Scherpenzeel and Saris, 1995 ;   Scherpenzeel, 2002 ).  Statistical analysis of the data was performed with IBM SPSS  (version 27) statistical software for Windows; with a margin in the  level of accuracy of 95% and an error level of 5% (statistical  significance level of   α   =   0.05).  Results  This research begins with an exploratory qualitative approach,  followed by a quantitative analysis of the preliminary results  obtained in the interviews. The use of a mixed-method research  plays an important role because results obtained from both  qualitative and quantitative methods enrich our understanding of  the problems and questions of our research topic ( Creswell, 2009 ;  Molina-Azorín, 2016 ).  Qualitative analyses  Our study reveals that female students who drop out do not  find practice-oriented subjects or collaborative projects in the  first course, feel a lower self-efficacy perception than male  students, and agree with the idea that Engineering majors fit  better with male gender roles much more than non-drop out  female students and, sometimes, experience a chilly climate in  the classroom.  After each quote, in brackets, we have noted the number of the  interview and if it is a male or a female who drops out (OUT) or  persists (IN). For example (I19_Female IN), corresponds to  interview number 19 which is a female who persists in an  Engineering major. The encoding density, for females who drop  out,   females   who   persist,   and   males   who   drop   out,   can  be appreciated in   Supplementary Figures 1 – 3 .  Role congruency perception  Female students who remain in these majors think that  horizontal gender segregation is something that we, as a  society, have overcome. Furthermore, women who did not drop  out have found that they can make an impact in society  through Engineering.  “It does not have to be like this. Each person has their own  goals and motivations and can do anything that he or she  wants, right now, in the middle of 2022, in the middle of the  21 st   century. I believe that everyone can choose what they want  to do and visualize themselves in one way or another and  choose their path from there, without considering if they are  men or women.” (I19_Female IN)  “I believe that, in any profession, there are aspects that can  be achieved to make an impact in society... as an engineer,  I believe that I can make a real impact in our society and  contribute with very good achievements without being a  doctor or nurse.” (I08_Female IN)  However, female students who withdraw tend to think that  these fields are less aligned with female gender roles, even having  chosen them in the first place.  “I think that as women, we are more focused on taking care  and worrying about others [...] There is a social norm that  assumes women must take care of people: disabled, children,  or even little brothers or sisters. Family care always falls on us  and men can dedicate themselves to reaching success. So yes,  I   think it has something to do with having different  aspirations.” (I29_Female OUT)  “It is true that the vast majority of men are more focused on  being successful, and I think that my family and friends  assumed that since I did volunteer work, I was going to choose  a major related to care, such as social work, and by the time  I wanted to change, I found that everyone expected me to quit  Engineering.” (I32_Female OUT)  Male students are equally aware of the different roles,  aspirations, and goals assigned to men and women. They find that

Page 9:
González-Pérez et al.   10.3389/fpsyg.2022.918439  Frontiers in   Psychology   09   frontiersin.org  society assumes that the most demanding and competitive careers,  such as Engineering, are not attractive to women and will remain  in male fields.  “That depends on how much each person has been influenced  by the gender roles that have been established. Society will tell  you if you are a woman, to become a nurse, for example. And  there is ninety-odd percent of nurses, but my brother is a  nurse. In other words, it is not to a certain extent what a  person really wants, because people are also conditioned by  society norms.” (I23_Male OUT)  “Absolutely. There are many studies that corroborate it,  women have personality traits like compassion, empathy, and  more focus on people. However, men generally tend to focus  more on objects and tend to be   more competitive and  technical. And it will always remain this way. Although they  may try to set quotas, men will tend to choose more technical  majors, especially Engineering, as women will tend to choose  majors whether related to literature, nursing or focused on  caring. (...) Women and men have different motivations, of  course, from a psychological, biological, and sociological  point of view.” (I34_Male OUT)  Having high educated parents (Social Economic Status)  positively influenced choices not congruent with gender roles for  some students, as mentioned by the following interviewee:  “And with the help of my parents, who are university  professors, they helped me clear my head, putting together my  concerns, and the things I liked, suggesting that Engineering  could be the best choice for me.” (I06_Female IN)  “Both my parents have Law majors, and they told me that it  was a very good career choice, but as soon as I told them that  I   was interested in Physical Engineering they were also  delighted and supported me.” (I01_Female IN)  Goals  Four female students who persist and four men who have  dropped out refer to early experiences in science as a relevant  factor for choosing Engineering. None of the female students that  withdrew referred to this type of previous experience. On the  other hand, six female students who persist in Engineering refer  to having been influenced by role models, compared with just one  woman and one man who dropped out. Therefore, learning  vicariously from role models appears to be   a powerful tool  resulting in higher motivation for female students to pursue and  persist in Engineering.  We find out that women who persist in STEM majors tend to  have had early experiences and role models that have helped them  to build strong goals and motivation to pursue these studies. These  influences seem to have reduced their gender stereotypes and  made them feel more aligned with these male-dominated majors  and roles.  “Well, since I was a little girl, I have always liked science,  I asked for gifts of chemistry sets for Christmas. I have always  been good at maths and physics at school ... I have been given  books on why things happen, and why natural phenomena  happen, which also helps a lot to be interested in science. And  my family. In my family, there are several engineers, my uncle,  my grandfather, my cousins, who have been real role models  to me...” (I05_Female IN)  “People always tell me that I should have studied medicine  because I am a very curious person and I am always asking  what everything means, but I think that my curiosity fits much  more with getting an engineering degree because in the end  you learn from so many things and explain many realities that  we have around us.” (I09_Female IN)  Therefore, having contact with science or role models in the  early years appears to help women to reduce their gender  stereotypes, allowing them to broaden their horizons and  consider other types of majors not necessarily aligned with  gender roles.  On the other hand, we find that female students who dropped  out of engineering majors usually have not had these early science  experiences or the influence of a significant role model. We have  found that these women tend to choose these majors based more  on agentic values, such as having a better job in the future or  earning more money. These goals and motivation could not  be sufficient to persist when a difficulty appears, as they are not  congruent with what is expected from a woman.  “I thought that Engineering was a career that had many  professional opportunities because you can do Engineering  and work as an engineer or join a consulting firm and dedicate  yourself to the business world because in the end it gives  you some maths tools and makes it much easier for you to get  into any work (...) And that was what I   liked about  Engineering, I loved the idea of having an advantage over  other candidates who could apply for a job [...] I have never  seen myself working in the Engineering world, I have always  had the business world in my head.” (I28_Female OUT)  “In my case, I correspond to the profile of a person who wants  to achieve success in life, not for getting recognition, but on a  personal level. In other words, I am a very demanding person,  and I knew that I wanted to pursue a career that would  be interesting and lead me to have a job that I liked and where  I could advance and grow.” (I26_Female OUT)  On the other hand, also men students who have withdrawn  from Engineering seem to be guided by agentic values, congruent  with their gender roles.

Page 10:
González-Pérez et al.   10.3389/fpsyg.2022.918439  Frontiers in   Psychology   10   frontiersin.org  “I was guided by the idea that by studying Engineering you will  have more open doors, or you will have a greater variety of  possibilities, or even being able to choose more types of paths  if you want to change at a given moment.” (I13_Male OUT)  “It was a challenge for me, while other careers did not  challenge me at that moment [...] I decided to do Engineering  because it was starting with the most difficult major, even not  having a very clear idea what I wanted, and leaving sometime  later to start other paths.” (I25_Male OUT)  It seems that women who stay in Engineering have found  intrinsic motivation. However, both women and men who have  dropped out mimic male traits based on extrinsic motivation,  which does not seem enough for helping them to persist in  the major.  Self-efficacy perception  Low self-efficacy is one of the strongest barriers that  women face. This low self-efficacy keeps women on the back  foot in engineering majors, limits their aspirations, and leads  them to feel they do not suit them. This feeling of low self-  efficacy stands out especially in female students, regardless of  whether   they   have   dropped   out   or   not.   Failing   exams  repeatedly, having many tasks and exams to do, and comparing  themselves with others are some of the arguments put forward  by the participants:  “(...) except for the first exam, what I do is fail and even  though you have to dedicate many hours to it, and you have  to study a lot, I felt that I did not get ahead (...) Yes, I felt  frustrated and compared to my classmates, maybe, I don’t  know, I didn’t understand very well why they were getting  good marks and I couldn’t.” (I17_Female OUT)  “There comes a time when you have so much pressure, so  many things that something in your head tells you ‘I can’t.”  (I03_Female IN)  “Sometimes you were very well prepared, and you couldn’t get  it because it was a very high level, so, for me sometimes there  was a feeling of impotence.” (I08_Female IN)  Sometimes, even though they get good marks, they play  this down:  “I have a friend (a female student), for example, who got a  very good grade in a subject that she was retaking, and it was  like oh, well, since I retook it, well obviously I’m going to  be among the best, however it was more than that: she was  very good. However, she was always saying that it was because  she   had   retaken   it   and,   well,   it   was   normal.”   (I32_  Female OUT)  As one of the participants shows, low(er) self-efficacy  perception has a strong relation with impostor syndrome, the  psychological   pattern   in   which   one   doubts   one’s  accomplishments, which makes these women have a persistent  internalized fear of being exposed as a ‘fraud’ ( Langford and  Clance, 1993 ). This is a self-limiting feeling ( de Vries, 1990 ), very  much in line with the role incongruity these women feel  ( Hernandez   Bark   et   al.,   2016 )   being   in   a   world   that  belongs to men:  “Impostor syndrome in a woman’s life is inevitable. And more  so in a world of men. It’s just that it’s impossible not to feel  inferior when you’re also getting into a mess all your life that  isn’t your place as such.” (I29_Female OUT)  Maybe all of this is due to the fact that women self-impose  higher quality standards. Not only do they have to contend  with the pressure of their studies but with their own feelings.  Referring   to   this   situation,   one   participant   mentioned  the following:  “(...) moreover, we are also generally very, very demanding  with ourselves. We   always try to give our best.” (I09_  Female IN)  Another female student missed more motivation from  the university:  “I missed having an encouraging push, that they gave me a  vote of confidence. (...) someone who told me: come on  XXX, you’re going to do very well (...) I would have liked  a greater motivation towards myself to achieve it, I think  that although it would have been difficult because it is  difficult and I do not deny that, however, if they had given  me a greater vote of confidence, maybe I would have got it.”  (I26_Female OUT)  However, this feeling is not shared by their male counterparts,  even though they have dropped out:  “No, at no time. The truth is that even now (after dropping  out) I see myself perfectly qualified to study and graduate in  Telecommunications Engineering.” (I22_Male OUT)  “No, I always have the impression that if I managed to focus  and get serious about it, I would have got it perfectly.” (I23_  Male OUT)  Curriculum perception  Harsh competitive grading systems, densely packed curricula,  and a lack of teaching for conceptual understanding ( Seymour,  1995 ;   Zohar   and   Sela,   2003 )   negatively   affect   women  undergraduates in STEM majors. Whereas, hands-on tasks,  employing active learning techniques, communal, collaborative

González-Pérez et al.   10.3389/fpsyg.2022.918439  Frontiers in   Psychology   11   frontiersin.org  learning environments, and teaching an understanding of the  social relevance of physics in their everyday worlds have a positive  impact on self-efficacy ( Jansen et al., 2015 ).  Interviewees highlight the difficulty of the subjects, the  assessment of learning, the overload of work, and the lack of time  to do it. Three participants express it in the following way:  “Some subjects are almost impossible, either because they are  difficult, or because there is a lot of content within the syllabus,  many things to study (...) The assessment is also a hindrance,  they set some minimums to pass, and it is very complicated...  (...) there is a lot of theory and a lot of volume for a short  period of time.” (I03_Female IN)  “The Bologna plan places great emphasis on doing many  things throughout the year (...). You also must slow down at  some point. I always had exams or homework, and I think  that sometimes that was quite problematic, because you are  always overwhelmed, you always have things to do.” (I32_  Female OUT)  Indeed, this situation led the participants to a lack of  motivation because they were unable to adapt. There are numerous  examples of drop out men and women who described their  experience in the following ways:  “The pressure with this new way of studying, was difficult for  me.” (I20_Female OUT)  “One of the reasons why I got frustrated with the degree was  because (studying telecommunications engineering), during  the first year, we did all the programming exams on paper (he  refers to not using computers).” (I32_Male OUT)  Another male student goes on saying:  “You lose motivation because it is not oriented to the real  world. (...) what I found most was how abstract and outdated  I saw the ways of teaching.” (I25_Male OUT)  Since in the first courses there are hardly any collaborative  projects or practice-oriented subjects, women who persist  especially value this type of learning:  “Practical activities help you to get an idea of what work is like  after leaving university. And obviously that helps a lot to  motivate you to do your best.” (I07_Female IN)  “Collaborative work has been useful to deepen and put into  practice what we have studied (...) it gives more meaning to  work...I’m doing it for a reason... I   am   fighting for  something.” (I09_Female IN)  While another female participant who dropped out, posits:  “In the last courses I   felt more comfortable (...) since  we   had   a   lot   of   practice-oriented   subjects,   a   lot   of  laboratories... thanks to those collaborative environments  in small groups I had a closer relationship with lectures.”  (I32_Female OUT)  Considering the methods of assessment, as a key part of the  curriculum, we found that there were mentions about low grades  by seven female students who stayed in Engineering, compared  with six who dropped out. Their male counterparts who dropped  out from the major seemed to be less affected by this low grading  as none of them referred to it as a barrier. It could be explained by  women’s double standards, as they judge themselves more  rigorously about grades. Women entering Engineering tend to  be overachievers, who have had the best grades in high school.  This can cause a sense of failure and of being out of place, affecting  belongingness and even self-efficacy perception. Nevertheless, it  does not seem to be something specific to female students who  drop out, it appears to be a barrier that needs to be overcome by  female students in general.  “Sometimes you were very well prepared, however you could  not pass because they asked for an unattainable level, so,  I sometimes had a feeling of impotence.” (I08_Female IN)  “I had a very bad time, June of last year was one of the worst  moments I’ve ever experienced. Because I have never tried so  hard to be able to get something without any success. [...]  Your exam is shit? I have been told that many times, many  times. And my tears were falling, because you cannot tell me  that my exam is shit because you do not know the work  behind the exam. You do not know the work behind your zero  ...” (I26_Female OUT)  However, an assessment method that encourages competition  over collaboration is a system where female students do not feel  comfortable, as stated by interviewees:  “And you   were surrounded by guys that ... were really  competitive, and I felt ... a bad vibe, because that doesn’t work  for me at all.” (I09_Female IN)  “Men tend to be more aggressive, and competitive (...) And  I think that it is because they are more used to competing, not  just academically, but in life.” (I20_Female OUT)  Finally, when students were asked about their study and  personal life balance, this barrier was mentioned mostly by drop  out students (male and female), it looks like female students who  have persisted have been able to find some kind of balance:  “Having a life while you’re in college seems very complicated  to me... the amount of time you   need to study was  disproportionate, I felt ... overwhelmed, without time for my

Page 12:
González-Pérez et al.   10.3389/fpsyg.2022.918439  Frontiers in   Psychology   12   frontiersin.org  own life, family and friends. It seems that it is like a part of  your life was missing. In other words, it’s like focusing all the  time on studying, because if you don’t, you won’t get there...  maybe it had to be more years... instead of you spending your  entire life studying.” (I14_Female OUT)  “I am very well organized. I have to relax and have free time,  maybe I’ll start studying soon and then I make plans, because  if I am studying all day it won’t work for me. [...] And yes,  I think that you need to organize yourself well and to study  your daily hours, your 5 daily hours.” (I31_Female IN)  Sense of belongingness  Women can experience a chilly climate with teachers or  with their classmates. Chilly climate stands out as a barrier  which can block the route to their degrees, including feelings of  isolation and intimidation, sexual harassment as well as a loss  in self-confidence as they progressed through their major  program ( Blickenstaff, 2005 ). Female students generally receive  less attention from teachers than their male counterparts  regardless of the subject or age of students ( Wilkinson and  Marrett, 1985 ;   Sadker and Sadker, 1994 ). Furthermore, student–  teacher interactions are qualitatively different for male and  female students as well, while women ask more questions than  men, teachers give them less feedback ( Spear, 1984 ;   Eccles and  Blumenfeld, 1985 ;   Sadker and Sadker, 1994 ). Four participants  express this situation in the following way:  “There was a professor who ..., it was my second enrolment  in Calculus, I went to review my exam .... and professors  were quite old in general ... so, he saw me, a woman having  failed calculus for the second time and told me that I wasn’t  suitable for Engineering. And in the end it takes you down.  And I even considered leaving Engineering and studying  something else that has nothing to do with Engineering,  because they have told me precisely that I was not suitable.”  (I02_Female IN)  “I had to do a project with a male classmate and when I asked  the teacher questions, the teacher always addressed my  classmate, never me, he didn’t explain things to me.” (I14_  Female OUT)  Some female participants experienced difficulties integrating  with their classmates also:  “I have had experiences with male classmates of not speaking  to me or to any of the other women in class until they realized  that I had the best grades and then, suddenly I was a person  with whom they wanted to talk a lot.” (I32_Female OUT)  “A friend of mine, XXX (female) was also very, very smart and  she was very good at Engineering. So, our male classmates did  not ignore her because she was intelligent and she helped a lot,  but nevertheless, if they saw that you couldn’t contribute, they  leave you aside.” (I20_Female OUT)  Even though female students who do not find any problems  still feel outsiders in men’s networks. They do not feel they match  the masculine interests, and struggle to get into a group. According  to two respondents:  “Not only is it difficult to integrate into conversations  outside class, but also in class, when groups are formed  because of the things they have in common or simply  because they are men ... for a group project, one chooses  friends (...) that closeness is difficult to have in the group  or even the confidence to comment on things more  calmly... for example, right now I have a project with four  colleagues and several times they met to do part of the  work among themselves. And they didn’t tell me anything  ... (...) Many times you   don’t even feel like attending  classes because you know what you’re going to find, the  conversations they’re going to have, even small jokes....”  (I07_Female IN)  “The way in which men relate to each other or the interests  they may have outside of university are very different from  what we (women) may have or the problems we may have.  (...) For me it was not the same as being with my friends  (women). Many times (when we met out of university) I went  with a friend (female) because I did not feel comfortable.”  (I06_Female IN)  And all of this affects the sense of belongingness. One  participant shared the following statement referring to the  competitiveness among men:  “I didn’t like that atmosphere of competition and comparison  of grades.” (I20_Female OUT)  Others refer to the organizational system, as the university  insists on the importance of changing your mind and thinking like  an engineer, however some felt that they did not fit into that claim  and that the system should change:  “I felt very alone, I felt that we had to know everything (...)  I didn’t find any kind of support, no matter how much I asked  for it.” (I21_MaleOUT)  “(...) I think that the system should change for those people  who don’t fit in.” (I26_Female OUT)  In any case, both drop-out and non-drop out female  students agree on the importance of having a good group of  classmates at the university that supports you   to continue  your studies:

Page 13:
González-Pérez et al.   10.3389/fpsyg.2022.918439  Frontiers in   Psychology   13   frontiersin.org  “At university I have a very good group of friends with whom  I do my homework, study and attend classes. We help and  support each other when we don’t understand something, an  exam goes wrong or if we are missing some notes... It helps a  lot to share worries, successes and failures. This makes  studying and everyday life more enjoyable and easier.” (I05_  Female IN)  “I met women and some guys with common interests and that  helped me a lot. I think it is important to be comfortable at  university. (...) in general, you must really want to persist and  as much as you like a major, if you are alone, you feel alone,  and it is very difficult for you   to take it forward.” (I32_  Female OUT)  Persistence  Analyzing the reasons that female and male students posit for  dropping out, we found that there were important differences.  Women tend to argue that they have faced mostly psychological  pressure and emotional barriers.  “For me they were psychological barriers, because I left school  with good grades and even though I   was warned that  Engineering was very hard, well I entered and basically except  for the first exam, I failed everything. Even dedicating many  hours and studying a lot, I felt that I was not able to go  forward and that you need a huge capacity for sacrifice and  being very smart to be able to graduate at the end.” (I17_  Female OUT)  “You must expect the failure. This sounds very hard, but it’s  even harder to get through your first exam having studied 8  hours a day and get a 2 or a 1. And sometimes we are not  psychologically prepared for it, especially because in high  school when we study, we pass and, in the university, it is not  like that. What they do not tell you at the beginning of the  major is that even having studied, you are going to fail.” (I16_  Female OUT)  However, male students tend to cite their reasons for dropping  out as not being sufficiently motivated, they never mentioned  feeling they were not capable. In fact, men posit that they could  cope with this high level of difficulty if they had made the effort.  The problem for them was that the content was not what they  have expected.  “The problem was the work that was going to be performed  after graduation because Engineering is extremely difficult,  but it’s nothing you can’t do, if you’re serious about it. But it’s  just that so much work, so much effort to make a piece of  metal.” (I23_Male OUT)  “I think it’s because of motivation, what I’m telling you is that  it was difficult to find a way to start studying things that are  not very attractive for most people. And realize that you don’t  want to do that anymore. More than you can’t, it’s just that  you don’t want to.” (I25_Male OUT)  Interventions or measures to pursue  Female interviewees who have persisted in Engineering  shared different measures or recommendations that have helped  them. Six of them refer to emotional support from family  and friends:  “The support of your family, friends, people you trust, who  encourage you to keep trying and not giving up, I think that  in my case it has been the most important thing.” (I06_  Female IN)  Seven students also mentioned the importance of having a  support network within the university: friends and colleagues with  whom you   can share your problems, your failures and your  successes. Students posit that this allows you to not feel alone and  be   constant and persistent, maintaining the pace of such a  demanding major.  “At the university I have a very good group of friends with  whom I do homework, study and go to class. We help and  support each other when we don’t understand the subjects, an  exam goes wrong or if we have missed some notes. It helps a  lot to be able to share worries, successes and failures. This  makes studying and everyday life more enjoyable and easier.”  (I05_Female IN)  “The most important thing is to count on your classmates  because we have done teamwork, asked questions and I think  it is super effective because they are people who are available  practically 24 hours a day, you can write them whenever  you want and there is always a classmate who is super smart  and will know how to solve any problem or you will be able to  help others with something that they have not understood,  that is, you will always find someone who will be able to help  you.”(I27_Female IN)  Several personal qualities were also mentioned that can  be   helpful to succeed in Engineering. Among them, self-  confidence was brought up by five students, while optimism  and hope were other valuable qualities that were mentioned.  “It is very important, of course, not to lose hope, because  this is a long-distance race and to hold on and finish it  you   need hope and to think that you   can do it.” (I07_  Female IN)  “I would tell them that they can do it and that they should not  believe that the male student next to them in class is smarter  or that he can do better than them.” (I09_Female IN)

According to   Eurostat (2021) ,   in 2019, out of a total of  15.4 million posts in Science & Engineering (including physicists,  mathematicians, life science professionals, and engineers), there  were only 6.3 million female scientists and engineers accounting  for 41% of all employment in the European Union. In the OECD  countries, the percentage of graduates in Engineering reaches  14%, however, the composition is very different between men and  women. Among men, the percentage reaches 25%, while among  women only 7%. A situation is very similar to that found in Spain,  where women in engineering are 6% compared to 22% of men.  However, there are OECD countries where this situation has been  mitigated, as is the case of Iceland ( OECD, 2019 ). STEM fields are  not only essential to improve our quality of life; they are expected  to grow by 10.5% between 2020 and 2030 in the United States ( US  Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2021 ). Currently, the top 25 college  degrees by pay and demand are all in STEM subjects ( World  Economic Forum, 2021 ), mainly in male-dominated jobs (i.e.,  top   5:   Architectural   Engineering,   Construction   Services,  Computer   Engineering,   Aerospace   Engineering,   and  Transportation Sciences and Technologies). Despite this, a large  number of STEM undergraduates drop out of their fields.  Compared with non-STEM studies, STEM drop-out is in general  higher; this is even more marked in the case of women, with  female students displaying a 23% higher drop-out rate than their  male counterparts, even though these female students in STEM  appear to be   positively selected in terms of study capital  ( Isphording and Qendrai, 2019 ). Barriers to entry into STEM  education for female students have gained strong attention from  education researchers, such as gender stereotypes (i.e.,   Master  et al., 2016 ), prior achievement and attitudes ( Marsh et al., 2019 ),  or in general, social factors, institutional structures, poor advice  and early education environments ( Blackburn, 2017 ). However,  subsequent gender differences in continuing to pursue STEM  studies are less well studied. Even interventions performed to  improve graduation rates for students in STEM (i.e.,   Hamm et al.,  2020 ) do not consider gender a core issue (just as a control  variable). Among all the STEM disciplines, Engineering is one of  the most male-dominated due to its well-recognized difficulty  ( Center   of   Research   and   Educational   Documentation   and  Women’s Institute, 1988 ;   López-Sáez et al., 2011 ). Research in  higher education indicates that there are many factors that  influence female students’ retention in Engineering ( Blickenstaff,  2005 ;   Eddy and Brownell, 2016 ), contributing to perpetuating the  gender gap in this type of major. The lack of women in Engineering  is a concern shared by public and educational institutions  ( Chavatzia, 2017 ) Despite such increasing efforts to find solutions,  we   continue to struggle to understand the reasons that lead  women to leave Engineering degrees ( Beasley and Fischer, 2012 ;  Makarem and Wang, 2020 ). This study aims to tackle the gender  gap in progression in Engineering majors, drawing on two  theoretical approaches from both motivation and gender studies  through a mixed qualitative-quantitative methodology that will  allow delving into the Engineering drop-out phenomenon for  female students. Thus, this study aims to address this gap by  examining the reasons why female students withdraw from  Engineering studies, and to find effective interventions to improve  retention rates.  Summing up, this paper contributes to the literature through  three main points:  1.   Analyzing gender differences in drop out from Engineering  majors, but also comparing with female students who  continue their studies.  2.   Giving a voice to female students who have dropped out of  such careers, using the in-depth interview technique to  listen to their personal experiences.  3.   Providing outcomes that will facilitate the design of  adjusted interventions. Understanding the reasons for  dropping out will help to devise more effective and efficient  strategies for women to stay in STEM careers.  Engineering dropout: Student motivation  and the Tinto’s persistence model  Students do not seek to be retained, they seek to persist ( Tinto,  2015 ). Students’ persistence could not happen without proper  motivation, as Engineering students are faced with a very  challenging curriculum ( Wang and Degol, 2013 ;   Kelly, 2016 ) and  need to expend a huge effort to succeed in their studies. To  increase completion rates, institutions are required to adopt a  student perspective, to understand how students’ motivation is  shaped and which measures or interventions can be addressed to  enhance this motivation. When adopting this student perspective,  they must do so taking into account that the reality of women and  men is not the same, i.e., adopting a gender perspective. According  to the   European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE) (n.d.) ,   this  means taking gender-based differences into account when looking  at any social phenomenon, policy, or process. We will base our  study on two different but complementary theories: one that  comes from the field of education ( Tinto, 1975 ,   2015 ) and another  from gender studies (social role theory,   Eagly, 1987a ) to explain  and promote the persistence of female students in Engineering  majors. Tinto’s model is a conceptually useful framework to  analyze student dropout since it reflects the process that an  undergraduate student experiences between the decision to  abandon or continue their studies. This scheme is based on the  fact that in order to continue and be successful, students must  integrate socially and academically into the university. Thus, Tinto  integrates the academic and social perspectives and ties them  together to explain student dropout. The social role theory argues  that the proximal causes of sex differences in individual behavior  are framed by gender roles or the shared beliefs that apply to  individuals based on their socially identified sex ( Eagly, 1987a , b ;  Eagly et al., 2004 ). Because in all cultures women and men tend to  specialize in different behaviors, people have different beliefs  about what each sex can and should do, i.e., gender roles are

Page 3:
González-Pérez et al.   10.3389/fpsyg.2022.918439  Frontiers in   Psychology   03   frontiersin.org  descriptive and prescriptive ( Wood and Eagly, 2010 ). These beliefs  constitute socially shared stereotypes within a society, meaning  that gender roles are reflected in a society’s stereotypes about men  and women. As   Wood and Eagly (2010)   point out, the descriptive  aspect of gender roles indicates what is typical for each sex, so  people rely on this information when they are concerned about  what is normal for their sex. On the other side, the prescriptive  aspect describes what is desirable and admirable for ache sex, so  people rely on this information when are motivated to gain social  approval or to bolster their own esteem. Thus, in the case of  Engineering, women might feel that they are not accomplishing  their gender social role of nurturing and they do not identify that  Engineering may lead to fulfilling communal goals. In this way,  social role theory in general, and the (communal) goal congruity  perspective ( Diekman and Steinberg, 2013 ) in particular, will  work as a gender mainstreaming theory while developing research  questions related to Tinto’s persistence theory to understand how  women’s entry, engage and exit of a specific social role (i.e.,  STEM career).  To be motivated means to be moved to do something ( Ryan  and Deci, 2000 ). It is a factor that leads behavior and determines  its direction, force, and insistence ( Sevinc et al., 2011 ). Also,  motivation is a theoretical concept that is used to explain the  beginning, direction, force, and insistence of goal-oriented  behavior ( Brophy, 2004 ). This insistence on goal-oriented behavior  or persistence is a manifestation of motivation ( Bandura, 1989 ).  However, whereas early experiences and goals can lead students  to choose Engineering, this motivation changes over time, as  students face different college experiences that may affect their  willingness to persist.   Tinto (2015)   proposed that persistence is  driven by motivation, which is determined by the lower-order  factors of self-efficacy perception, sense of belonging, perceived  worth, and relevance of the curriculum. At the heart of Tinto’s  model, there is the idea that to be successful, and therefore persist,  a student must be well integrated both socially and academically  into the college system ( Tinto, 1975 ,   1987 ). Nevertheless, this  integration does not come only from the student but also from the  educational environment. In this sense, the social and academic  factors linked to the educational environment can help or hinder  the integration of students ( Casad et al., 2019 ). This is a useful  framework within which not only to investigate the process of  student attrition and persistence in Engineering but also to  identify possible interventions to reduce withdrawal. Tinto’s  perspective requires a holistic approach to studying dropouts  taking in different kinds of factors, highlighting that this  withdrawal is a process in which it is possible to act ( Tinto, 1998 ).  Tinto’s model remains one of the most widely used and cited  models in understanding and explaining students’ dropouts  ( Braxton and Hirschy, 2004 ;   Keup, 2005 ;   Bensimon, 2007 ;  D’Amico et al., 2014 ), also regarding those in STEM disciplines  (i.e.,   Nicoletti, 2019 ;   Johnson et al., 2020 ). In particular,   Botanga  et al. (2021)   found in a sample of underrepresented students  minority (URM) of STEM that Tinto’s model focuses on  integration and belonging, but fails to theorize concepts related to  student agency, racial identity, and racism, so important in this  URM group. These results stress the need to adapt the model to  different samples, such as we do in the case of women in STEM.  Engineering dropout: The persistence  model from a gender perspective  The social role theory ( Eagly, 1987a ) offers a framework to  understand how features of social roles intersect with individuals’  goals and role pursuits in general, and of women in STEM in  particular. Therefore, our research adapts Tinto’s model of student  motivation and persistence ( Tinto, 2015 ) considering gender role  congruity,   so,   student’s   circumstances   and   inputs   should  be included, incorporating their perspective on the main barriers  and obstacles that might have undermined their motivation and  their willingness to persist in their academic trajectories from a  gender perspective ( Figure 1 ).  Tinto (1987)   posited that a departure decision was a process  by which a student who experienced lack of motivation decided  not to persist with college studies. One of the first and more  important input variables to determine students’ motivation are  goals. According to   Locke and Latham’s (1990)   of goal setting  theory, a goal is defined as what the individual is consciously  trying to do. Goals direct attention and action. Furthermore,  challenging goals mobilize energy and lead to higher effort,  motivating people to develop strategies that will enable them to  perform at the required goal levels. Also, the goal accomplishment  can lead to satisfaction and further motivation whereas their  non-accomplishment can lead to frustration and lower motivation.  Goals are shaped by early experiences ( Tinto, 1975 ) as they help  specify the orientations the student brings into the college. Goals  are a very complex issue and should be   approached as a  multidimensional   variable.   Tinto   (1998)   identified   family  background, prior schooling and skills and abilities as the main  factors shaping students’ goals. In this line, the goal congruity  perspective ( Diekman and Steinberg, 2013 ;   Diekman et al., 2017 )  may help to explain why women enter, engage in and exit STEM  pursuits, as it provides a framework to understand how motives  influence social role selection, and in turn how these social roles  afford or impede the pursuit of goals. This perspective is based on  the social role theory, which posits that sex differences in  individual behaviour are framed by gender roles, or the shared  beliefs that apply to individuals on the basis of their socially  identified sex ( Eagly, 1987a ;   Eagly et al., 2004 ). For both sexes,  good fit to the opportunities afforded by their society yields  rewards in terms of ease of completing important tasks and  building satisfying interpersonal relationships, so individuals thus  (consciously or not) are more likely to seek and attain the goals  that are afforded by their roles ( Diekman and Eagly, 2008 ).  According to the goal congruity framework, an important aspect  of STEM decisions is the belief that STEM careers do not fulfil  communal, other-oriented goals ( Diekman and Steinberg, 2013 ),  which is not aligned (goal incongruity) with women’s roles.

González-Pérez et al.   10.3389/fpsyg.2022.918439  Frontiers in   Psychology   05   frontiersin.org  programs focused on self-efficacy sources have shown to be greatly  successful to increase interest towards STEAM (STEAM + Arts)  in female students ( Ofori-Boadu, 2018 ).  Motivation: Sense of belongingness  perspective  The third construct of Tinto’s model, belongingness, has been  linked with persistence at university ( Webb et al., 2017 ). It is  understood to be   the sense of connectedness an individual  experience within the learning environment ( Osterman, 2000 ). In  other words, belonging refers to students’ sense of being accepted,  valued, included, and encouraged by both teachers and peers and  of feeling an important part of the group ( Goodenow, 1993 ). The  literature suggests that there is a strong relationship between the  concept of belongingness and students’ self-efficacy perception  ( St-Amand et al., 2017 ). The quality of belongingness is dependent  on a variety of factors such as the level of a student’s involvement  in the different activities provided by college and the availability  of support, which finally builds a sense of connection ( Picciano,  2002 ). If these female students feel connected it will be more likely  that they will be receptive and more deeply engage in learning  ( Roxburgh, 2012 ), while if female students experience greater  uncertainty and feelings of not belonging, unsure of their social  bonds and sensitive to rejection, they are at more risk of dropping  out ( Walton et al., 2015 ). There has been much research around  the structural barriers that women face in STEM fields and that  make them feel like ‘strangers’ in science ( Massachusetts Institute  of Technology, 1999 ;   Sonnert et al., 2007 ).  Classroom climate affects students’ belongingness perception  and therefore their motivation and persistence in STEM ( Shapiro  and Sax, 2011 ). If female students in STEM face a difficult climate  in   the   classroom,   it   could   disproportionately   affect   them,  producing feelings of depression and lowering self-confidence  ( Strenta et al., 1994 ). Women entering a male-dominated field  may need to face social marginalization and may experience a  climate in which they may feel unwelcome ( Flam, 1991 ).   Colbeck  et   al. (2001)   suggest that this “chilly climate” for women in  Engineering results from peer interactions, which is especially  relevant as peer acceptance is a central concern in adolescence  ( Eaton et al., 1991 ). While it is perceived that peer interactions  affect students more than faculty interactions, teachers also have  an important role in making students feel comfortable and  accepted in college, as well as promoting students’ interest in their  subjects ( Astin and Sax, 1996 ).  Furthermore, women are more likely to leave STEM majors  compared to men, in part because they lack similar role models  such as teaching assistants and instructors ( Marx and Roman,  2002 ). Women exhibit a self-perception of belonging in STEM  culture and are more motivated to pursue studies in the presence  of female role models ( Stout et al., 2011 ). Nevertheless, men  comprise the majority of STEM faculties that may not only signal  that women do not belong or cannot succeed in these fields  ( Walton and Cohen, 2007 ) but also gives female students limited  access to female faculty role models. In this context, with a limited  representation of female students, even highly skilled and  motivated women may wonder whether they belong on STEM  major programs ( Cheryan et al., 2009 ), which elicits that a more  inclusive Engineering community is a crucial element so that  female students do not feel alone ( Ayre et al., 2013 ). However,  faculty can also be a threat to female persistence in STEM fields,  because as   Hall and Sandler (1982)   explain, faculty interactions  can dampen women’s ambitions, especially in male-dominated  fields such as Engineering. Furthermore, researchers such as  Wasburn and Miller (2004 ,   2005)   have found that faculties treated  male and female students differently, as they tend to be more  condescending, and less respectful to female students. They have  also found that faculties tend to exclude women from certain  activities, for example giving them menial tasks within group  projects. Grading criteria are often found unfair and biased,  especially as female students feel they need to excel more than  their male counterparts ( Seymour and Hewitt, 1997 ). These  authors found as well that ignoring, or tolerating misogynism, feel  female students unwelcome in class. In both cases, both male-peer  and faculty interaction might be biased due again to the goal and  trait   incongruence   that   they   perceive   between   the   female  (communal) traits and what is thought to be successful for a  masculinized career (agentic), which might in turn lead to  prejudice against women (see for instance   Eagly and Karau, 2002 ,  about women leaders, i.e., in a masculinized career). Consequently,  women might divert from STEM pathways because of gender  stereotypes and prejudice ( Diekman et al., 2017 ). For instance,  both male and female science faculty have shown gender bias in  preferring male over female applicants for a lab manager position,  even when qualifications were matched experimentally ( Moss-  Racusin et al., 2012 ).  Motivation: Curriculum perception perspective  Curriculum, the last element of Tinto’s model explaining  motivation, is explained in turn and affected by the sense of  belonging ( Webb et al., 2017 ). Curriculum needs to be understood  in an extended way, considering not only what is being taught  ( Kelly, 2009 ), but also the methods of assessment. Notably,  students in STEM fields often earn lower grades than students in  other fields ( Ma and Liu, 2015 ). This is another factor that  hindered female students studying for a degree in Engineering, as  perception of low grades seems to be more discouraging for them  than for their male counterparts ( Lent et al., 2002 ). Moreover, the  usage of curve-grading assignments encourages competition,  where male students tend to feel significantly more comfortable,  preventing cooperation and peer support ( Guzdial et al., 2001 ).  Griffith (2010)   found that students feel that classes in  Engineering tend to be boring and needlessly difficult, forcing  them to spend many hours and make huge efforts, sometimes  without the desired outcome. This situation affects female students  to a greater extent, undermining their perception of belonging and  leading to them opting to drop out to a greater extent than their  male counterparts ( Seymour, 1995 ).   Seron et al. (2018)   discovered  that during the first 2 years of Engineering majors, it would

Page 14:
González-Pérez et al.   10.3389/fpsyg.2022.918439  Frontiers in   Psychology   14   frontiersin.org  Quantitative results  In the interviews, we asked participants to quantify some of  the nodes. Mann–Whitney U test was used to analyze differences  in the mean values between male and female students who have  dropped out (see   Table 1 ) and between female students who  persist and females who have dropped out (see   Table 2 ).  While comparing quantitative results from male and female  students that have dropped out, no significant differences were  found. Thus, even though it might seem that the main reasons for  dropping out might have been similar, the underlying insights  seem to have affected them differently. Whereas the comparison  between female students who persist and females who have  dropped out shows significant differences in goals, curriculum  perception, and sense of belongingness.  Regarding goals, the results highlight that there are differences  in the perception of gender role congruity perception between  female students who drop out and those who do not. Female  students withdrawing from Engineering find that there are greater  differences between interests and aspirations (goals). Even having  chosen this type of major at first, these women end up thinking  that there are still different career paths for women and men. The  question that arises is if they have always considered that there are  careers more suitable for women or men or if the experience in a  male-dominated major has led them to this perception.  Concerning curriculum perception, significant differences  were found since non-drop-out female students seem to prefer  practical   and   collaborative   subjects.   However,   this   can  be explained by the fact that the interviewees state that this  practical content is taught in the last years of the major. Therefore,  students who have dropped out may not have had the opportunity  to learn this practical content.  In   the   case   of   self-efficacy   perception,   no   significant  differences were found between self-efficacy perception for female  students who persist and those who do not.  Lastly, in the case of sense of belongingness, marginal  significance was found. Drop-out students found this climate  much more difficult than their peers who have not dropped out.  This is consistent with the qualitative findings as having a network  of friends in class is mentioned as one of the key elements  to persist.  Conclusion and discussion  This research contributes to the literature ( Wolffram et al.,  2009 ;   Sweeney, 2020 ;   Mickelson et al., 2022 ) on amplifying Tinto’s  persistence model from a gendered perspective. The findings of  the present study make several important contributions to the  existing literature on persistence in engineering majors, which can  help future research and policies on this topic. Much of the  previous   research   focused   on   reasons   to   persist   without  considering gender bias. Understanding how gender stereotypes  and roles congruity affect female persistence can help to design  better and more effective interventions.  Although Tinto’s model has received different critiques in the  last years, with authors proposing its extension to include specific  facets that might affect to concrete population (i.e.,   Botanga et al.,  2021 ,   with URM), our results support the theoretical model as a  general   framework   to   understand   women   drop   out   from  Engineering when including the gender perspective. In this line, our  results show that all the theoretical constructs proposed by the  model (i.e., goals, curriculum perception, self-efficacy, sense of  belongingness) work as (des)motivators in the expected way.  Besides, although some results appear to be non-gendered (for  instance, intrinsic motivators work better for both men and women  to persist on the major), most of them are clearly gendered. In this  line, most of the reasons of why women drop-out can be explained  from the social role theory ( Eagly, 1987a , b ) as mainstreaming in  each of the Tinto’s model constructs. Thus, no having contact with  science or Engineer women that act as role models in early years  affect female students both in establishing goals and in the sense of  a low self-efficacy perception; the role-incongruity perception  between being women (communal goals) and studying Engineering  majors (agentic goals) affect not only to women themselves  (increasing the impostor syndrome) but also to peer and teachers’  support, which increases the chilly environment and, in return,  decrease their sense of belongingness. In this line, drop-out women  still consider that there are still different career paths for women and  men (different goals). Also, there are differences at the curricula, as  female students who drop out do not find practice-oriented subjects  or collaborative projects in the first course that could serve as  mastery experiences, which leads to a decrease of their self-efficacy.

González-Pérez et al.   10.3389/fpsyg.2022.918439  Frontiers in   Psychology   15   frontiersin.org  Thus, in global, all this results in the fact that women tend to argue  that they have faced mostly psychological pressure and emotional  barriers, whereas men never mentioned it.  This research will allow to implement effective interventions  to increase women’s persistence in engineering majors. The study  advances our understanding of the barriers and obstacles that face  female students in Engineering showing that motivation to persist  is the result of multiple factors (i.e., goals, self-efficacy, curriculum,  sense of belonging) that are affected by gender role perceptions.  In the following sections, we will point out the most remarkable  results and relate them with its practical implication in form of  intervention proposals.  Role congruency perception and role  models  Our findings suggest that role congruency perception and lack  of role models are more pronounced in female students who drop  out. They also suggest that students know nearly nothing about  the practical applications of Engineering when they enroll at  university. Thus, it would be important to have interventions in  early years, when gender stereotypes begin to affect expectations,  interests and academic choices. Role models have been shown by  extensive prior literature to be critical in motivating students to  follow a path and achieve goals ( Collins, 1996 ;   Lockwood and  Kunda, 1997 ). However, there is no unanimous agreement on how  these models should be. Certainly, they must be seen as competent  and successful by female students ( Marx et al., 2013 ). Likewise, it  is essential that they can feel identified, so they must belong to the  same gender and ethnicity ( Lockwood, 2006 ). Regarding lack of  knowledge about the content of Engineering and its practical  application, we recommend holding sessions in high schools for  both female and male students ( Falco and Summers, 2019 ). These  sessions could be held by current Engineering female students,  because it will be easier for high schoolers to identify with them  ( Mussweiler, 2003 ). Relating to the content, we propose that these  role models focus on how these professions can contribute to  society, showing innovations congruent with communal goals led  by female engineers ( Boucher et al., 2017 ). It is important to  highlight that these professions solve real problems, can help  others and improve our lives ( González-Pérez et   al., 2020 ).  We recommend holding these interventions for both female and  male students as it is also important for male students to dispel  gender stereotypes. Nevertheless, these sessions could also be held  by men not conforming to agentic masculine stereotypes, which  could help women and girls to see them as allies ( Cheryan et al.,  2011 ).   Furthermore,   university   summer   sessions   for   high  schoolers could be a game-changing early experience to boost  interest in Engineering ( Kitchen et al., 2018 ). To reduce these  gender stereotypes, it could be interesting to have informative  sessions with high school teachers and families to broaden their  minds, as parents and teachers become principal role models,  advisors and supporters for females’ academic choices ( Gunderson  et al., 2012 ). Furthermore, we suggest inviting career advisors at  high school level, as they could unbiasedly help students to find  what they are good at and what career paths are more suitable for  them regarding their interests and strengths ( Falco, 2017 ).  Self-efficacy perception  A second conclusion of our research is that female students,  regardless of whether they have dropped out or not, tend to have  lower self-efficacy perceptions than males, which can lead them  to drop out. Female students often self-impose higher standards  of excellence, making them believe that they are not capable of  persisting. In a context where women are a minority and, as noted,  face multiple barriers, extensive previous research has identified  self-efficacy as a key predictor of women’s success in engineering  ( Blaisdell, 2000 ;   Marra et al., 2005 ). To promote self-efficacy  perception, it is worthwhile focusing on the self-efficacy sources  proposed   by   Bandura   (1997) .   So,   following   Betz   (2004) ,  we   propose intervention programs that would include: (1)  activities in which they can recognize that they are/were successful  (mastery experiences), (2) interaction with female role models  (both professionals and recent students) through mentorship  programs (social modelling), (3) professors focusing on students’  success   and   capability   to   perform   difficult   tasks   (verbal  persuasion), and (4) promoting positive emotions through both  interventions to foster a growth mindset highlighting that  intelligence   and   ability   are   not   fixed   traits   and   positive  psychological programs (emotional and physiological states) to  positively influence their criteria to judge their capability and  vulnerability. These interventions can help to demonstrate that  hard work and effort can help female students to overcome  challenges, and that they are able to do it.  Sense of belongingness  Sense of belongingness becomes a key predictive factor in terms  of persistence ( Walton et al., 2015 ). According to our results, both  drop-out and non-drop out female students agree on the importance  of having a group of classmates at university and a family that support  you to continue your studies. Literature has identified that the sense  of belonging is related to the skills to make an effort in the face of  difficulties ( Vaz et al., 2015 ). These skills become even more relevant  in a context such as that of engineering students who need to  overcome important barriers and, on many occasions, feel alone and  without support ( Strayhorn, 2018 ). On the one side, having a strong  supportive network of peers motivates female students to not drop  out ( Limbert, 1995 ). Therefore, we propose mentorship programs  within the university where freshman engineering students are mixed  with sophomore, junior or senior engineering students ( Packard,  1999 ) with the aim of retaining female students through a nurturing  mentoring program, designed to build a network with other female  Engineering students with whom they can easily identify ( Stout et al.,

Page 16:
González-Pérez et al.   10.3389/fpsyg.2022.918439  Frontiers in   Psychology   16   frontiersin.org  2011 ). Thus, these programs will enhance personal support through  contacts with peer female role models, will build confidence and self-  efficacy as mentees will see that their mentors have been able to  succeed in Engineering and provides valuable emotional support.  This mentorship program can also involve collaboration between  university students and networks of engineers, in order to help seniors  in   their   immersion   in   the   professional   workplace.   Another  intervention could be peer-led team ( Horwitz et al., 2009 ) learning to  provide female students with an efficient and supportive study group,  where through workshops, a coached student who has previously  been successful in the course facilitates learning. It could also  be   interesting to promote interventions with male and female  students to highlight the importance that diversity has for innovation,  promoting mix-gendered groups. Finally, student-run clubs and  initiatives can also enhance a sense of belonging ( Sahin, 2013 ).  On the other side, as it is crucial for a sense of belongingness to  feel   encouraged   and   motivated   by   the   faculty,   the   Gender  Compliance Committee or Diversity and Inclusion Dean should  have   more   significance.   Communications,   performance   and  language to detect gender stereotypes need to be carefully reviewed  to mitigate gender stereotypes ( Cheryan et al., 2011 ). Following  Blickenstaff (2005) ,   course materials and assignments should also  be reviewed to add female scientists and their achievements to shift  perceptions about who belongs, while promoting diversity-related  activities. Furthermore, training or workshops with the faculty to  foster some self-reflection, review performance, identify gender bias  and implement solutions could be another interesting intervention.  Curriculum perception  Another finding of our research are the masculine biases in the  curriculum that sometimes prevent female students from persisting.  Its content is adapted to the interests and perspectives of both the  teacher and the dominant social group in the class, or both ( Beder,  1989 ;   Lewis, 1995 ). This leads to a new difficulty for engineering  students since, since most of the faculty and engineering students are  men, they may feel uncomfortable or excluded in class. In short, the  content of the curriculum becomes a new barrier that can lead  students to drop out, switch or not succeed in their majors. Therefore,  we propose active learning and project-based instruction using  collaboration techniques from the first years ( Zastavker et al., 2006 ;  Dominguez et al., 2019 ), to enhance a sense of community rather  than a competitive environment. Incorporating service-learning  projects to promote the idea that Engineering helps to improve  society and allowing more choice in terms of subjects could boost  interest and motivation. These new subjects could be more focused  on social purposes, environmental impact or sustainability ethics that  connect better with communal goals ( Diekman et al., 2015 ).  Apart   from   the   curriculum   itself,   our   research   found  masculine biases in the grading systems. We suggest increasing  collaboration rather than competitiveness. Instead of multiple-  choice tests or exams where only the final answer matters,  we   propose replacing them with open-ended evaluations. A  constructive response system that allows students to show their  competence through writing has been proved to be more suitable  for female students ( Weaver and Raptis, 2001 ).  Conclusion  Finally, as a general intervention for fostering persistence,  we suggest highlighting the importance of building soft skills, as  mentioned before in the case of self-efficacy. Self-efficacy, hope,  resilience and optimism (positive psychological capital;   Luthans  et al., 2007 ) are qualities that can help female students to overcome  the obstacles and barriers they will find in their academic and  professional careers. On the other hand, having counselling and  psychological services could be a useful tool to reduce stress,  anxiety and depression among female students.  In conclusion, based on the findings of this research, including  a gendered perspective in Engineering fields provide a promising  route to retaining female students. With our empirical results,  we have been able to validate our proposed theoretical framework  and build upon each of the parts of Tinto’s well-known validated  theoretical   model   of   persistence,   incorporating   this   gender  perspective. Women who drop out of Engineering highlight in the  interviews that goals incongruity leads them to low levels of  motivation, affecting persistence. The results show that this lack of  congruity   influences   mainly   belongingness   and   self-efficacy  perception. There are several practices that institutions should revisit  and rethink to provide the necessary support to Engineering female  students who are struggling. According to the gender differences  outlined in this research, we cannot understand women’s persistence  in engineering without a gender perspective. Women enter male-  dominated majors where they do not feel as if they belong; for  instance, they stated that they are more comfortable responding to  praise than to challenge. We   have found that including these  communal goals for real could improve retention in these majors, as  they could be seen as congruent with their priorities. Findings from  the   present   study   allow   policymakers   and   organizations   to  implement   interventions   which   encourage   female   student  persistence in male-dominated fields. Providing women with a  strong support system can help them to prevail over barriers which  they may face during their Engineering education. All these  measures should be   accompanied by a learning and social  environment that promotes the reduction of gender stereotypes  ( Solbes-Canales et al., 2020 ), so the next generation of potential  female engineers believe that they will be successful.  Limitations and directions for future  research  These results are based on a limited sample of female engineers  who have dropped out. A larger sample would be desirable, especially  to strength the quantitative analysis with more robust methodologies.  It would also be interesting to delve into whether the reasons are

The findings from the present study suggest other promising  directions for future research, for example to carry out a longitudinal  study. Understanding what kinds of barriers students face at different  points in their careers can provide a more comprehensive view and  help design effective measures.
