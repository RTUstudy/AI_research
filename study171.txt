In view of the obtained results, it  is concluded that the existence of a series of factors such as age, gender, support from  the closest environment and a democratic and ethical leadership style by the institutions,  along with the social actions of communicating and generating synergies, favours success  in the attainment of a doctorate degree. To sum up, the results of this study suggest the  convenience of carrying out prosocial actions aimed at finishing the PhD stage successfully.

Este  proceso ha implicado tradicionalmente una profunda soledad y el desarrollo de problemas  que afectan a la salud de los doctorandos. El objetivo de la investigación fue realizar un  meta-análisis para comprobar la influencia de determinadas variables sociodemográficas  y personales en el abandono de estudios de doctorado. Tras una revisión de la literatura  existente y de acuerdo con los criterios de inclusión y exclusión, la muestra total fue de 9  artículos, que contenían un total de 53 muestras y 32760 estudiantes de doctorado con  una edad media de 29.80 años. Los principales resultados muestran que la permanencia en  el programa de doctorado depende del género, la edad y de variables personales, siendo  el apoyo social (apoyo familiar, apoyo institucional y autoestima) el que explica el 11% de  la permanencia en el programa de doctorado, seguido de la autoestima, mientras que el  burnout   explica un porcentaje muy bajo del éxito (Tau 2   = 0.40; I 2   = 99.48; R 2   = .03; p = .001).  El modelo que mejor explica la permanencia en el doctorado parte del apoyo social. De esta  forma, los estudiantes de doctorado demandan el apoyo de sus iguales, familia e institución,  pudiendo ser nuestros resultados explicados por el rol tan importante que tiene el apoyo  social como mediador de las consecuencias del estrés. Del mismo modo, el papel de la familia  y el entorno más cercano no son los únicos elementos relevantes; las universidades, como  organizaciones, también pueden favorecer un entorno adecuado, agradable y motivador a  través de estilos de liderazgo democráticos y al promover actividades sociales que permitan  a los estudiantes de doctorado establecer relaciones socioafectivas que les proporcionen  bienestar emocional, una red de aprendizaje y sinergias.

Educación XX1 ,   27   (1), 105-129   107  How to survive the doctorate? A meta-analysis of succes in PhD Candidates  INTRODUCTION  In the university scope, the research and teaching career can only be accessed by  attaining the title of Doctor. Despite being considered the last step in the educational  stage, the doctorate is a job; given the tasks to be performed, the work of a PhD  student can be understood as a service profession in three scopes: teacher, student  and researcher (Sorrel et al. 2020). Firstly, PhD students take on a teaching role by  sharing their knowledge and expertise with other students. This aspect of doctoral  work entails the responsibility of transmitting knowledge and guiding others in  their learning process. Secondly, PhD students continue to be learners throughout  their doctoral program. They participate in courses, workshops, and conferences to  expand their knowledge in their specific field of study. Additionally, they must stay  updated on the latest advancements in their research area and constantly update  their skills and competencies. Lastly, PhD students are researchers in their own field  of study. They dedicate a significant amount of time and effort to original research,  contributing to the existing knowledge in their field. Their research work is crucial  for advancing the understanding and development of new ideas, theories, and  practices in their discipline. In addition, getting a Phd is a process that is associated  with high pressure, levels of stress and loneliness (Mattijssen et al., 2020). For that  reason, success in the doctorate depends on different variables.  Firstly, regarding the socio-demographic variables, previous studies such as  those of Castello et al. (2017) and Sverdlik et al. (2018) show that age and gender  affect the success and well-being of PhD students (Schmidt & Hansson, 2018).  In this way, not only inter- and intra-personal factors or personal goals (Devos et  al., 2017; Sverdlik et al., 2018) affect this process, but gender and age also play a  relevant role in it (Devos et al., 2017; Ivankova & Stick, 2007; Leonard et al., 2005;  O’Meara et al., 2013; Sverdlik et al., 2018). Regarding gender, it has been found  that women present greater emotional exhaustion and intentions to drop out of  the academic career (Hunter & Devine, 2016). Moreover, it is important to highlight  that the academic career is perceived as hierarchical, making it difficult for women  to access them (Eslen-Ziya & Murat, 2022).  Age, on its part, is a significant variable in terms of doctorate dropout, in a way  that, the greater the age of the PhD student and the lower the social support, the  greater the probability of dropping out of the doctorate programme (González -  Betancor & Dorta - González, 2020; Hunter & Devine, 2016).  Another variable that impacts the completion or abandonment of the doctorate  programme is stress, specifically burnout. This term refers to a chronic response  to workplace stress, which leads to a physical, mentally and emotional state of  exhaustion (Maresca et al., 2022). In this sense, it has been demonstrated that PhD  students with a work overload derived from the prolonged exposure to stressful

Page 4:
Lozano-Blasco et al. (2024)  108   Educación XX1 ,   27   (1), 105-129  factors can develop other types of disorders, such as depression or anxiety (Kusurkar  et al., 2021). The prevalence of students with burnout who will develop other mental  diseases is very alarming, posing, in this case, one of the most important variables  that influence the abandonment of the doctorate programme (Sorrel et al., 2020).  Some variables related to burnout in doctorate students are: studying the PhD in  one’s home city, having a pre-doctoral contract whose aim is the realisation of the  doctoral thesis, and having current or past psychological treatments for disorders  such as anxiety or depression (Sorrel et al., 2020).  Moreover, personal variables such as resilience and emotional intelligence  are usually considered personal factors that influence the way in which stress and  burnout are managed (Blanco-Donoso et al., 2015; García-Izquierdo et al., 2018).  In this regard, there are specific populations where it has been demonstrated  that resilience could reduce burnout syndrome (Healy et al., 2022; Montgomery  & Patrician, 2022). As for emotional intelligence, it seems to be mediating career  flexibility, coping attitudes as well as self-control, all of them related to burnout  (Ahmed et al., 2022; Jahanzeb et al., 2023).  Lastly, social support has been one of the most studied variables in its association  with stress. In the academic scope, it has been demonstrated that, when support  comes from the family, it is related to greater levels of academic success than when  it comes from the thesis director (Song et al., 2015). In this sense, anyone who  intends to attain a PhD, with the aim of culminating the educational stage, requires  support, aspirations, capacities and skills for research and teaching (Kim et al.,  2018). In this way, it has been identified that the lack of perceived social support is  related to a lower well-being in the doctorate student and to a greater probability  of developing mental disorders (Levecque et al., 2017; Sverdlik et al., 2018). Thus,  social support is demanded by PhD students as an important need; they need to  feel supported and have someone to talk to (Lech et al., 2018). Moreover, social  support is strongly and positively related to self-esteem (Li et al., 2018) and both  factors are related to academic success, with a greater probability of adapting to  the chosen career when self-esteem and perceived social support are higher (Ataç  et al., 2018).  In the light of the above, some authors have proposed some strategies to  prevent and mitigate the effect of burnout. As an example, institutional measures  should prioritise the establishment of more conducive work environments that  mitigate factors leading to burnout and assist students in managing the interplay  between their personal and academic lives, which can contribute to feelings of  exhaustion (McAlpine et al., 2020). Finally, it is also important to promote team  meetings so this measure could increase the perception of social support among  peers and supervisors (Gorbenko et al., 2019).

Educación XX1 ,   27   (1), 105-129   109  How to survive the doctorate? A meta-analysis of succes in PhD Candidates  For the above reasons, the main aim of this study was to perform a review  of the scientific evidence, through a meta-analysis, to verify which variables are  more strongly related to the rate of dropout from PhD studies. In that sense,  variables included in this study were socio-demographic variables (age, gender and  geographical area) and personal variables (social support, personality factors and  burnout).  METHOD  The research record complied with the principles established by Cochrane in  Higgins and Green (2011) and PRISMA (2020). Similarly, the inclusion criteria and  exclusion criteria responded to the parameters established by Botella and Sánchez  (2015) and Moreau and Gamble (2020) (Table 1):  Table 1  Inclusion and exclusion criteria  Inclusion criteria  Sample: doctorate students, with or without contracts that bind them to a  university or research centre (Izquierdo-Martínez, 2007).  Research methodology: experimental, clinical, correlational and quantitative  (Friese & Frankenbach, 2020).  Publication date: 2016 - 2021 (Bashir, et al., 2018). The purpose of this time  frame is to carry out an updated study.  Methodological rigour: studies with recognised prestige, published in Q1  indexed journals (Scimago Journal & Country Rank).  Measurement   instruments:   psychometric   tests   evaluated   in   academic  publications to measure the psychological variables (Hunter & Schmidt, 2004;  Friese & Frankenbach, 2020).  Exclusion criteria  Adult population with previous disorders or pathologies. However, we included  those studies in which there were control groups without pathologies, i.e.,  normally developing populations.  Statistical and methodological rigour: the existence of ambiguous data, the  absence of data treatment, or evaluations that did not comply with the principles  of psychometry, as well as measurement errors, attending to the guidelines  established by Hunter and Schmidt (2004) and Friese and Frankenbach (2020).

(2024)  114   Educación XX1 ,   27   (1), 105-129  Figure 2  Forest plot  Regarding the factors of heterogeneity, the Q value of Der Simonian and Laird  (1986) showed a very high variability, which allows rejecting the hypothesis of  homogeneity (Q = 13403.910; df = 57; p < .001). Moreover, it is worth highlighting  the value of I 2 , which shows that 99% of the variability is explained by the  methodological and sample heterogeneity of the studies (I 2   = 99.575) and not by  chance (Higgins & Thompson, 2002). These data are in line with the heterogeneity  test, which provides a value of H² = 235.156, supporting the existence of high  diversity (Higgins & Thompson, 2002). With respect to the estimation of the meta-

To sum up, the heterogeneity analysis shows that the  variables of remaining in the doctorate programme are significant. Analogously, it  was observed that the sample of the study was very diverse.  Figure 3  Log-likelihood for τ².  The Omnibus test of model coefficients presented a reliable value of Q = 32.531  (p < .001) (Aguinis & Edwards, 2014). To sum up, high heterogeneity was confirmed,  thus confirming the suitability of working with the random effects model (Bonett &  Price, 2015; Martín-Andrés & Luna del Castillo, 2004).  It is important to verify the absence of bias effect (Botella & Sánchez, 2015;  Botella & Gambara 2002). To this end, Egger ́s test was conducted, with 99%  reliability. The data confirm the absence of publication bias, showing the following  values: z = 0.380, p = .704 (DerSimoian & Laird, 2015). Moreover, the standard error  was not high (SE = 3.20), indicating the proximity to the regression line, with this  being related to the absence of publication bias (Martín-Andrés & Luna del Castillo,  2004). The rank correlation test for funnel plot asymmetry presents a non-significant  Kendall value of τ = 0.123 (p = .198), indicating the absence of publication bias.  Furthermore, the funnel graph (Figure 4) reflects the variability that was  previously found, corroborating that the source of this variability was the diverse

After analysing Figure 4, we can state that heterogeneity is high, since there  are values scattered from the average. That is, most of the studies of the sample  are clearly separated from the figure. These studies present more extreme data,  although, during the conversion of a normal curve to a Fisher curve, the values  above 0.5 suffered a certain deformation and were even farther from the average.  Consequently, it was necessary to carry out a model comparison and a meta-  regression that allowed studying these aspects.  Figure 4  Funnel plot  Moderating variables and meta-regression analysis  The review of the scientific evidence showed that there are moderating variables  which demand the realisation of comparative models (Botella & Sánchez, 2015) and  meta-regression. In this case, the common moderating variables in all the analysed  articles are: model 1 – masculine gender; model 2 – feminine gender; model 3 –  age; model 4 – geographical area; and model 5 – personal variables (Table 4).  We found that models 2 (feminine gender) and 4 (geographical area) do not  explain, at any percentage, the variance of remaining in the doctorate programme.  However, model 1 reveals that undertaking a doctorate programme and remaining

A meta-analysis of succes in PhD Candidates  DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION  The aim of this study was to explore the association of the variables of remaining  in the doctorate programme and the socio-demographic variables (age, gender  and geographical area) with personal variables (social support, personality factors  and burnout). The statistical results and those of the systematic review show that  remaining in the doctorate programme is favoured by being an older man, and that  social support (i.e., family support, institutional support and self-esteem) is the  model that better explains permanence in the PhD.  Firstly, it is necessary to describe the relevance of gender. A stronger relationship  was found between being a man and remaining in the doctorate programme. There  are differences in the professional expectations in terms of gender, thus, even  though women show a greater desire to enter the academic world of teaching in  higher education, they show a low tendency to access research and integrate into the  academic world (Guo et al., 2018). In fact, women claim to be more afraid of being  discriminated against when looking for a job compared to their male equivalents  (Branigan, 2014; Wang, 2018; Wang et al., 2019). Moreover, some authors have  also found that women present greater emotional exhaustion and intentions to  abandon their academic career (Hunter & Devine, 2016).  Regarding age, it proved to be a very influential variable in PhD dropouts.  However, previous research has stated that the older the age of the doctorate  student and the lower the social support received, the greater the probability  of abandoning the thesis (González - Betancor & Dorta - González, 2020; Hunter  & Devine, 2016). Similarly, in a problematic situation, age was the variable that  encouraged the doctorate student to request a change of thesis director (González -  Betancor & Dorta - González, 2020). Likewise, emotional exhaustion was also a  variable that influenced doctorate dropout, increasing with age (Cornér et al., 2017;  Hunter & Devine, 2016). According to our results, we hypothesised that age could  be mediating more psychological variables, such as resilience. In that sense, the  older a person is, the more resilient (Mauno et al., 2012), buffering the impact of  stress and increasing the likelihood of remaining in the doctorate.  Although not all the variables corresponded to the individual differences, the  environment in which a human being develops plays a key role in any social process.  In this sense, it is necessary to work from three models: a) social support (family,  institution and self-esteem), b) personality variables (self-esteem) and c) burnout,  which explains the problem very poorly.  According to our results, the model that best explains permanence in doctorate  studies is social support. This has been one of the most studied variables in its  relationship with stress. As was stated by other authors, doctorate students  demand support from their peers, families and institutions to which they are

Page 17:
Educación XX1 ,   27   (1), 105-129   121  How to survive the doctorate? A meta-analysis of succes in PhD Candidates  from the basic psychological needs pushes doctorate students toward unrest and  burnout (Kusurkar et al., 2020). Moreover, the authors of the mentioned study state  that the perception of low autonomy and self-esteem seems to be mediated by  external variables, which poses a challenge to academic institutions (Kusurkar et  al., 2020). In this sense, the behaviour of doctorate students seems to be influenced  by the leadership style of the university centre, in a way that a leadership based  on integrity and ethics increases the confidence of the researchers (Edward et  al., 2020). Thus, responsibility, motivation, the feeling of growth, creativity and  productivity are positively correlated with the policies of proactive leadership of  the university (Edward et al., 2020). On their part, Voitenko et al. (2020) described  the importance of not only self-esteem, but also coping strategies, self-realisation  and responsibility (Voitenko et al., 2020). In this sense, it was found that coping  strategies varied under emotional stress and exhaustion, as well as due to the desire  of satisfying the needs of self-realisation (Voitenko et al., 2020). In this respect,  Corner et al. (2017) claimed that the experiences of exhaustion are related to the  intention of dropping out. Thus, coping strategies can reduce the stress derived  from self-realisation, which is adjusted with time and age (Voitenko et al., 2020).  Lastly, burnout was found to be related to PhD dropout. Other authors had  already reported this association, highlighting burnout as one of the main difficulties  in the realisation of a doctorate (Kusurkar et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2019; Sorrel et al.  2020; Zahniser et al., 2017). As was previously mentioned, a PhD can be understood  as a job (Sorrel et al., 2020), which would explain the appearance of high levels of  burnout. Moreover, the diversity of roles can cause a conflict of ambiguity, thus  generating a source of additional stress (Zahniser et al., 2017). Likewise, burnout was  related to other variables that appeared throughout the course of the study, such as  self-esteem and social support, finding that a lack of the latter two would increase  the risk of suffering from burnout during a doctorate programme (Blanco-Donoso  et al., 2019; Hobfoll & Shirom, 2000). This strong relationship can be explained  by the possibility that the main stressors of workers would be those aspects that  prevent them from attaining their goals and which generate a lack of existential  significance. These aspects affect exhaustion and commitment directly, although  they also have an indirect effect through certain personal resources (Hermann &  Wichmann, 2017).  The present study has a series of limitations that must be pointed out. Firstly,  there is an alarming absence of studies conducted in developing countries, except  for Nigeria. Analogously, there is a lack of data on Latin America, Southeastern  Asia, Middle East and Oceania. Doctorate studies take place in all nations, and it  is the beginning of the scientific and academic career, being an essential part of  quality science and higher education. On the other hand, the limited information  regarding areas of specialisation, average duration of doctoral studies, economic

Page 18:
Lozano-Blasco et al. (2024)  122   Educación XX1 ,   27   (1), 105-129  compensation, traditional or compilation-based research models, internationally  recognized doctorate programs, affiliation with a funded research group, the  availability of continuous education provided by the University or Research Centre,  as well as the ownership of the centres, presents social limitations that should be  analysed in future research.  Further research should include a correlational and longitudinal study with  doctorate students and other types of variables, such as the existence or absence  of a working contract, attending to the personal variables presented in this study,  although also addressing mental health.  As is demonstrated, doctorate studies have a very specific particularity, which  is the fact that, in addition to being considered studies of a higher order, they are  also understood as work practice. Thus, variables such as being a man, greater self-  esteem and greater social support were related to permanence in PhD studies.  Moreover, burnout plays a crucial role, fostering doctorate dropout and being  strongly related to the previously mentioned variables. Similarly, the role of the  family and the closest environment are not the only relevant elements; universities,  as organisations, can also favour a suitable, pleasant and motivating environment  through democratic leadership styles and by favouring social activities that allow  doctorate students to weave socio-affective relationships that provide them with  emotional well-being, a learning network and synergies.  It becomes fundamental to promote support to doctorate students in the  universities and institutions in which they carry out these studies, favouring a  working environment that enables job satisfaction and the increase of self-esteem.  This would contribute to improving the mental health of PhD students, reducing  the levels of burnout and advancing toward the creation of quality researchers and  faculty members.

This process  has traditionally implied a profound loneliness and the development of issues that affect  the health of PhD students. The objective of the research was to conduct a meta-analysis  to examine the influence of certain sociodemographic and personal variables on doctoral  dropout. Following a review of existing literature and based on inclusion and exclusion  criteria, the total sample consisted of 9 articles, which included a total of 53 samples and  32760 doctoral students with an average age of 29.80 years. The main results indicate that  the permanence in the doctoral program depends on gender, age, and personal variables,  with social support (family support, institutional support, and self-esteem) explaining 11%  of the persistence in the doctoral program, followed by self-esteem. Burnout, on the other  hand, explains a very small percentage of success (Tau 2   = 0.40; I 2   = 99.48; R 2   = .03; p =  .001). The model that best explains permanence in doctorate studies is social support.

A meta-analysis of succes in PhD Candidates  The   study   selection   was   carried   out   according   to   the   eligibility   criteria  established by Cochrane in Higgins and Green (2011) and PRISMA (2020). Thus, the  initial sample consisted of n= 1790623 studies, of which 137 were duplicates. To  manage this data, the results from each database were downloaded in csv format  and unified, specifying the database to which they belonged, the title, the journal,  and the abstract. In addition, it is necessary to mark by means of filters those  sources that are scientific, such as scientific journals, omitting other sources such  as newspapers. Thus, firstly, it was necessary to review systematically and manually  each of the studies, paying attention to the information presented in the abstract  and in the title. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were then applied, in the flowchart  (see Figure 1). During this screening phase, most of the results were omitted for  not responding to the study object in a clear or precise manner. In other words,  although they talked about the doctorate, they did not offer information on how  this process was carried out, nor what variables were relevant. In this sense, many  studies spoke of the importance of the doctorate as a generator of science and  innovation. The criterion of statistical and methodological rigour led to the rejection  of a considerable part of the sample, since, in most of them, the statistical data did  not provide a coherent response to the evaluation manuals employed. In addition,  much of the research was carried out using qualitative methodology, especially  semi-structured   interviews,   making   it   impossible   to   extract   statistical   data.  Moreover, there were no extreme data or data of higher or lower limits that would  not correspond to a normal distribution. Finally, it is noteworthy that many studies  could not be analysed because they were not open access. This is a difficulty, since  for the internal reliability of the systematic review process, it is necessary for any  researcher to be able to replicate this process.  The execution of the conversions of statistical values to Fisher’s Z scores was  operationalised using CMA software. This decision corresponds to the criteria  established by Martin-Andrés and Luna del Castillo (2004) on the importance of  selecting a unit of measurement that reduces statistical distortion. The CMA  statistical software was used to graphically represent the data through the figures  of Forest Plot and Funnel Plot, to calculate the absence of publication bias through  Egger’s test and to carry out the statistical analyses of heterogeneity, model  comparison and meta-regression on the moderating variables. Regarding the  latter, we analysed gender (men and women), age, geographic area, and personal  variables (social support, personality variables and burnout).

Lozano-Blasco et al. (2024)  112   Educación XX1 ,   27   (1), 105-129  RESULTS  Socio-demographic results of the sample  The sample of our study was constituted by 9 papers,   with   a total of K= 53  samples and a total of 32670 doctorate students (Table 3). The mean age of the  participants is 29.80 years. The predominating nationality is European (50%),  followed by the American nationality (20%). There was no coincidence of countries,  except for the USA, where two of the analysed studies were conducted. The rest  of the countries are: Sweden, Nigeria, France, Denmark, Netherlands, China and  Spain, which shows the diversity of countries in the present study. Lastly, the  largest sample was that of Hermann and Wichmann (2017), with 2244, whereas  the smallest sample corresponds to Hunter and Devine (2016), with 186 students.  It is important to mention that the sample size, K=53, exceeds the minimum value  established to prevent the distortion of the upper limit of confidence (Bonnet &  Price, 2014).

Secondly,  with model 3, age explains 17% of remaining in the doctorate programme, with  99% significance, and, with model 5, the personal variables explain 11%, with 99%  significance.

Regarding the  personal variables, three regression models were established: a) social support,  b) personality variables and c) burnout. With respect to social support (family,  institution, and self-esteem), we found that family support along with institutional  support and self-esteem explain 11% of remaining in the doctorate programme  (98% significance), with self-esteem being the most relevant variable, as is observed  in Table 5. Regarding personal variables (self-esteem, emotional intelligence,  open-mindedness and responsibility), it was found that self-esteem was the most  relevant variable, explaining 6% with p = .000. Lastly, burnout explains only 3%,  with p = .000. It is thus concluded that the most solid explanatory model is social  support.

In  this sense, our results can be explained by the relevant role of social support as  a mediator in the consequences of stress, and this relationship has been widely  demonstrated (Levecque et al., 2017; Sverdlik et al., 2018; Tompkins et al., 2018).  Moreover, institutional support is of great importance in the case of doctorate  studies, as is shown. Positive supervision and support from the thesis directors is  positively associated with productivity (Dysthe et al., 2006, Pyhältö et al., 2015),  and the latter, in turn, is related to satisfaction and workplace well-being (Hermann  & Wichmann, 2017; Miragaia & Aleixo, 2021). In this sense, the feeling of belonging  to the scientific community reduces the feelings of loneliness and dissatisfaction  (Corner et al., 2017; Hermann & Wichmann, 2017). Similarly, the perception of  abusive practices from the institution is considered a discouraging element (Edward  et al., 2015). Analogously, it is important to highlight that those students who feel  supported by their thesis directors perceive lower levels of stress (Haag, et al.  2018). In this sense, Corner et al. (2017) specified that the empathetic support of  the thesis director is essential, with the provision of feedback being a highly valued  element. Social support is strongly related to self-esteem, which largely depends  on the supported received from the institution (Liu, et al., 2019; Overall et al. 2011)  and the social context in which it takes place (Satuf et al., 2018).  The   results   showed   that,   indeed,   another   variable   that   influences   the  permanence in doctorate studies is self-esteem. Authors such as Liu et al. (2019)  state   that   self-esteem   and   self-management   are   determinant   for   scientific  performance and production within the doctorate programme. Their importance  is such that authors like Zahniser et al. (2017) pointed out the need to generate  measures that promote self-management and improve self-esteem from doctorate  programmes. In this way, the personal variables (or personality variables), with self-  esteem as the predominating variable, could be the most influential ones in the  abandonment of or permanence in doctorate studies. On its part, the loneliness that  doctorate students experience and a highly competitive environment are variables  that seem to be mediated by personal and individual traits. In this sense, the  social skills of doctorate students, along with their capacity to socialise, constitute  a process by which academic skills and competencies are acquired (Hermann &  Wichmann, 2017). According to Voitenko et al. (2020), emotional intelligence skills  help to manage oneself in a social and working environment. This view points out  that high-quality research is not the result of individual discoveries, but synergies  (Hermann & Wichmann, 2017). This perspective is in line with previous studies,  such as those of Boud and Lee (2005), although it is presented as a minority position  against the traditional view of the importance of individualism (Bastalich, 2017;  Jara,   2020). That is, it is necessary to recognise the holistic and voluntary practices  (Bastalich, 2017; Corner et al., 2017). Furthermore, the frustration that results

To calculate the  total sample, it is necessary to calculate the number of samples by the number of N samples (coinciding with the  number of waves of the studies).  Statistical analyses: effect size, heterogeneity and Egger’s test  The aim of this study was to explore the association of the variables of remaining  in the doctorate programme and the socio-demographic variables (age, gender and  geographical area) with personal variables (social support, personality factors and  burnout).  Once the sample of coefficients of correlation was obtained, the values were  converted to Fisher’s Z scores (Martin-Andrés & Luna-del-Castillo, 2004). According  to the Forest plot graph (see Figure 2), there was an effect size of r= .48, with a  lower limit of 0.32 and an upper limit of 0.64, and a statistical significance of p <  .0001. Likewise, a standard error of 0.084 was obtained, with a Z value of 5.704. The  effect size according to Cohen (1988) was moderate.
