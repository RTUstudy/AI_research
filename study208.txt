Dropout students are a severe problem in higher education (HE) in many countries. Student dropout has a tremendous negative impact not only on individuals but also on universities and socioeconomic. Consequently, preventing educational dropouts is a considerable challenge for HE ’ s institutions. Therefore, knowing the factors in fl uencing student dropout is an essential   fi rst step in preventing students from dropping out. This study uses a mix of qualitative and quantitative approaches. To determine what variables affect student dropout, we use a qualitative approach, after which the variables found will be validated by the public and stakeholders using a quantitative approach. Then, the next step is to classify variables using a quantitative approach. This study observes dropout students at private universities in Central Java, Indonesia. The   fi ndings reveal that personal economic factors, academic satisfaction, academic performance, and family economics are the most in fl uential. The results of this paper are signi fi cant for universities in Indonesia, especially Central Java, to overcome the problem of student dropouts, so that they are more precise in making decisions. In addition, the results of this study are also helpful for further research as a basis for predicting students dropping out of university.  1. Introduction  Student dropout in higher education (HE) is a prominent topic in many countries, such as Spain [1, 2], United States [3], Germany [4, 5], as well as Indonesia. Based on data from Pangkalan Data Perguruan Tinggi (PDDIKTI) (Higher Education Database) (2018, 2019), the percentage of students dropping out within the last 2 years was getting higher in Indonesia. In 2018, the dropout rate for students was 3 %   of the total stu- dents, with 245,810 student dropouts, and in 2019 was 8 % , with the number of dropout students 698,261. In 2019, the highest number of dropouts was found on the island of Java, with as many as 414,901 students. Central Java has the most signi fi cant growth in the number of dropout students, namely, 63,253 students. Based on the HE status, the dropout student rate of private higher education is more signi fi cant than public higher education. Figure 1 shows the students ’   ratio dropping out of students ’   total number for the last 2 years by higher education status. Dropout is a critical indicator of an educational system ’ s quality because it demonstrates the persistence of signi fi cant failures in direction, transition, adaptation, and student promotion [6]. Dropouts negatively impact individuals, uni- versities, and socioeconomic status in Indonesia: (1) student dropout involves physical and psychological loss at the indi- vidual level. Students experience depression due to inade- quacy and self-doubt, which are associated with dropouts. Besides, they will be aware of wasting time, money, effort, and personal resources: (2) dropouts at the university level have economic and educational consequences. From an eco- nomic perspective, the more dropouts, the worse university ’ s  fi nancial condition. From an academic perspective, dropout students indicate a red signal to the education system to provide convenient services for students; and (3) the socio- economic level, the dropout student ’ s effect can never be overlooked because university graduates provide notable in fl uences with both returns to education and the real eco- nomic growth. Therefore, preventing student dropout is a big challenge for private universities. The   fi rst step in preventing student dropouts is under- standing the elements contributing to it [7]. In Indonesia, just the number of dropout students is recorded; the reason for   the   dropout   is   not   given   any   particular   attention.

The second reason, students have dif fi culty working on their thesis is that the thesis material is dif fi cult. If it is seen from the questionnaires of students who dropped out for dif fi culty in working on their thesis, they have a low CGPA of 2.00 – 2.75. So, it can be concluded that CGPA is one of the important vari- ables that affected student dropouts. The third reason is a bad relationship with the supervisor/lecturer. Although based on a questionnaire on student satis- faction with learning, it was shown that their relation- ship with their supervisor/staff/lecturer/academic supervisor was good, there were still students who explained that they had dropped out for reasons that their relationship with their supervisor was not good. Therefore, the variable relationship between students and supervisors and lecturers is still considered one of the variables that are used to predict students dropping out of university. (3) The third reason students dropout is due to move their study program to another university. This hap- pens because the study program taken is not by their interests. From this point, it can be concluded that the study program interest is a critical variable affect- ing dropout students. (4) Dif fi culty in the following lesson: respondents have dif fi culty participating in learning due to the wrong study program. The study program they take is not in their interests. This strengthens point 3 that the study program of interest is an important variable in pre- dicting student dropouts. (5) The   fi fth reason students dropout is getting married. After they got married, they had dif fi culty in dividing their time for the university. In addition, after mar- riage, most of the respondents prioritize their   fi nances for their family rather than for college. From this point, it can be concluded that marital status is one of the important variables to predict student dropout. (6) The reason the six students dropped out was that the study program did not match their interests because the study program they took was their parents ’  choice. This point strengthens points 3 and 4, which conclude that the study program interest variable is an important factor in predicting student dropout. (7) The reason for the seven students dropping out is that academic satisfaction is not supportive. There are two points underlined in this reasoning: the   fi rst respondent felt that the quality of the lecturers was unsatisfactory. Although based on the questionnaire, results related to student satisfaction with learning show that the quality of the lecturers is satisfactory, and there are still students who dropout for this rea- son. Therefore, it is concluded that the variable lecture quality satisfaction is one of the variables that affect dropout students. The second point is the lack of good communication with staff/lecturers/supervisors. This supports the point that the relationship with the staff/ lecture variable is an important variable that affects student dropouts. From these points, it can be concluded that several important points   cause   students to dropout,   which   are shown in Figure 6.  4.2. Validation.   From Section 4.1, several variables were obtained that affect student dropouts. The next step is to validate the   fi ndings of the   fi rst stage, as shown in Figure 6.  4.2.1. Public Opinion Validation.   In the public validation questionnaire, there are   fi ve questions related to the charac- teristics of the respondents and nine statements of respon- dents ’   approval regarding the   fi ndings of variables that affect dropout students. Respondents are citizens of Central Java who have graduated from college/university at least with a diploma. Questions related to the characteristics of respon- dents include age, education level, profession, marital status, and previous education courses. The following are the con- clusions from stage 4.1 regarding variable approval and its effect on student dropout rates: parent income (N1), individ- ual income (N2), dif fi culty in doing a thesis (N3), low CGPA (N4), marital status (N5), study interest program (N6), employment status (N7), satisfaction with lecture quality (N8), and relationship with lecture/staff/supervisor (N9). N3 ’ s statement states that some students dropout because of dif fi culty in doing a thesis due to low CGPA and is rein- forced by N4 ’ s statement that low CGPA is one of the causes of students dropping out. Statements N3 and N4 con fi rm that the CGPA variable is one of the important variables used to predict student dropouts. The results of the analysis with Winsteps from 737 respondents obtained results, as shown in Table 1.

The last factor is the family ’ s economic, including the parent ’ s income and marital status. Economic factors are factors that signi fi cantly affect the number of dropouts in Indonesia. Suppose from the family, and there is no cost to continue their studies, in this case, it will automatically impact the student dropping out of college because there are no fees or other options for studying while working. Even though the student is looking while working, it will also impact the student not being focused on lectures and   fi nding it dif fi cult to divide his time. This is also supported from research by Tarmizi et al. [24], Yaacob et al. [25], Viloria et al. [30], Cuji Chacha et al. [31], and Mduma et al. [32] that parents ’   income affects drop- out students. Another family economic factor that affects dropout students is marital status. Married students will prior- itize their   fi nances for their families rather than their educa- tion. This is also supported from research by Tarmizi et al. [24], da Costa et al. [33], Yasmin [34], and Ashour [35], all of which indicate that marital status affects dropout students. A theoretical implication of this study is that four factors in fl uence dropout students at private universities in Indonesia, especially Central Java. These   fi ndings can be used as a basis for further research predicting dropout students in Central Java, Indonesia. Knowing the students who are predicted to dropout or not is the   fi rst step for policymakers to take pre- ventive actions. There   are   several   pedagogical implications   proposed from the   fi ndings of this study, including: (1) Socialization in universities is related to variables that affect student dropouts. This socialization is crucial to provide an initial explanation to the university to prevent student dropouts. (2) They are improving the quality of a comfortable lec- ture environment so that students themselves are more interested in the courses taken. The rate can be from the university ’ s learning atmosphere, service system, and facilities. (3) We are improving the quality of human resources, especially lecturers/academic supervisors. (4) Provide much motivation for students to focus on lectures and be innovative in dividing time between classes and work. (5) Provide services to students who experience pro- blems in learning or dif fi culties in understanding the material.  6. Conclusion and Limitations  Dropout is a crucial problem for universities that need to be overcome. The results of this study indicate that there are four-dimensional factors that in fl uence dropout students, including personal economic factor (individual income and employment status), academic satisfaction factor (relationship with lecturer and supervisor and lecturer quality satisfaction), academic performance factor (CGPA and program study interest), and economic family factor (parents income and marital status). The results of this study are signi fi cant as the basis for further research to predict and overcome drop- out students. This study has several shortcomings that must be dis- cussed and recommended for further research. This study uses a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods. A qualitative approach is used to look for variables that affect  Personal economic factor Individual income Employment status Parents income Academic performance factor CGPA Academic satisfaction factor Relationship with lecturer/supervisor Lecturer quality satisfaction Program study interest Family economic factor Marital status Factors that influence dropout students  F   IGURE   7: Factors that in fl uence dropout students.

Knowing the factors that in fl uence student dropouts will be very helpful in preventing dropouts. Therefore, the research question in this study is   “ What factors in fl uence students ’  decision to dropout of private universities in Central Java, Indonesia? ”   The results of this paper are signi fi cant for uni- versities in Indonesia, especially Central Java, to overcome the problem of dropping out of university so that they are more precise in making decisions. In addition, the results of this study are also helpful for further research as a basis for predicting student dropouts.  2. Literature Review  The initial step in preventing student dropouts is compre- hending the contributing factors [7]. The reason for student dropouts at HE is very complex and in fl uenced by several variables. Based on Mouton et al. ’ s [8] report, many factors in fl uence student dropouts in Germany. Often the reason is a combination of several factors. Mouton et al. used latent class analysis to identify dropout students. The results show why students dropout due to relationships with study programs or universities, socioeconomic factors, student performance, academic self-concept, and intention to dropout. Ortiz-Lozano et al. [2] observed the factors in fl uencing student dropouts in Spain based on sociodemographic and academic variables. The reason for choosing this variable is not clearly explained, but the research results show that this variable has a signi fi - cant effect. P é rez et al. [9] discussed the prediction analysis of dropout students in Colombia. The variables that affect student drop- outs in Colombia are student demographics and transcript records. These variables are used to predict dropout students, and the resulting variables signi fi cantly affect dropout stu- dents. Chen et al. [3] also researched the predictions of drop- outs in the United States. In Chen ’ s study, the variables used to predict dropout were high school information, demographics, college enrollment, and information per semester. It is not clearly explained reasons for taking these variables for predic- tions. However, based on the analysis results, the selected vari- ables signi fi cantly predict student dropout rates. Troelsen and Laursen [10] observed the factors in fl uencing dropout students in Denmark. According to them, two hypotheses in fl uence dropout students. The   fi rst hypothesis is that dropout students are affected by parental education and socioeconomics. The second hypothesis states that students dropout due to Danish government policies related to education, causing them to move to study programs, change universities, or not continue their studies. In predicting dropout students, selecting variables is one of the most critical stages because the variable is the primary construct in a study. From the previous research described, the factors in fl uencing dropout students from one country to another are different. This is supported by Troelsen and Laursen ’ s [10] study, which indicates that countries with distinct cultures have varying perceptions of the value of education. Consequently, the factors in fl uencing students ’  academic success or failure are diverse. Therefore, the vari- ables in fl uencing student dropout are adapted to the coun- try ’ s conditions. In addition, in existing research, the factor that in fl uences dropout students does not come from direct information from dropout students, so the accuracy of the variables still needs to be determined. Considering how important it is to understand the variables that in fl uence dropout students, this study aims to identify the factors that in fl uence dropout students in Indonesia. In this research, the primary source for determining the reasons for dropping out of college is direct information from students who have dropped out, followed by validation from the public and sta- keholders to strengthen these reasons.  3. Research Method  This research employs a combined qualitative and quantita- tive methodology [11]. The stages in this study are shown in Figure 2.  3.1. Step 1: Seeking Information Directly from Dropout Students.  A proper step to   fi nding out why students dropout of univer- sity is to seek information directly from dropout students. However, this is very dif fi cult, considering dropout is a sensi- tive matter. Two steps are taken to   fi nd more in-depth infor- mation related to why students dropout, namely, using questionnaires and indirect interviews (Figure 3). The   fi ve bases used to   fi nd more in-depth information regarding why students dropout using questionnaires are academic pro- grams, social and economic programs, institutional, academic performance, and personal, as in the previous research of  1% 3% 3% 18% 0   2   4   6   8   10   12   14   16   18   20 2018 2019 Year The dropout ratio in Central Java by higher education status Private Public Rate (%)  F IGURE   1: Student dropout based on higher education status.

Nurmalitasari et al. [12]. The questionnaire also includes cru- cial inquiries about why they dropped out and their satisfac- tion with learning. The survey was completed by 108 students who had dropped out of a private university in Central Java. After the respondent   fi lled out the questionnaire, the next step was to interview the respondent. The interview aims to dis- cover more in-depth reasons why the respondent experienced a dropout. Since dropout is a sensitive matter, interviews were conducted indirectly using messenger/chat. The interview method used is the unstructured interview. The critical point in the interview was why the respondent dropped out of the university. The interview guide is based on explaining why students dropout in the previous step.  3.2. Step 2: Validation.   The next step is to validate the   fi nd- ings of step 1. There are two validations: validation by public opinion using questionnaires and stakeholders using ques- tionnaires (Figure 4). The stakeholders referred to in this study are the rector, vice-rector, dean, and head of the study program. The purpose of this validation is that the variable ’ s  fi ndings can be used in a general conclusion related to vari- ables that affect student dropout. In this stage, the question- naire ’ s content is the respondents ’   agreement on the variables that affect student dropout   fi ndings from step 1. The ques- tionnaire used in the validation stage of public opinion with stakeholders is the same. Validity and reliability questionnaire using the Rasch model [12 – 14]. The Rasch model is an ana- lytical tool that can evaluate the validity and reliability of research instruments and the suitability of individuals and items, something that other analytical techniques have not matched [13, 15].  3.3. Step 3: Classi fi cations of Variables.   The third step of this study is to classify these variables into dimensions factors using the   categorical   principal   component   analysis   (CATPCA) [15, 16]. CATPCA is a technique for reducing the number of variables to make them more concise and uncorrelated with one another (principal components). Categorical variables were analyzed using the optimal scaling procedure, which converts categorical labels to numeric values [17]. Additionally, the variance accounted for (VAF) statistic is used to compare the maximization of the measured variables. The steps in the classi fi cation of variables are shown in Figure 5. In this step, we apply variables to university data. The university data used are unaffected by university af fi liation, as the variable ’ s selection has been subjected to public and stakeholder validation. The university data were gathered through the distribution of questionnaires to students who graduated from or dropped out of one of Central Java ’ s private universities. The questionnaire contents in this stage are student data related to the   fi ndings of the variable from step 2 and the status of the student ’ s exit (dropout or graduation).  4. Result  4.1. Seeking Information Directly from Dropout Students.  There are two steps taken to   fi nd more in-depth information related to why students dropout, namely, using question- naires and indirect interviews.  4.1.1. Step 1. Share Questionnaires to Dropout Students.   In the academic program, there are two points to be asked, namely, the class program and the year of enrollment. The questionnaire results show that 55 %   of dropout students come from nonregular program classes and the rest from regular classes. Then, when viewed from the year of enroll- ment, in 56 %   of students, the year of admission is not the same as the year of graduating from high school, and in the rest are those students, the year of entry is the same as the year of graduating from high school. In terms of social and economic factors, three points are discussed. The   fi rst is related to parental education; 44 %   of parents of dropout students have a high school diploma, 19 %  have an elementary school diploma, and the remainder have a junior high school diploma, a bachelor ’ s degree, a master ’ s degree, or are not enrolled in school. The second point is par- ents ’   income; 35 %   of the income of parents of dropout students is IDR 2,000,000 – 5,000,000, 53 %   of parents ’   income is below IDR 2,000,000, and the rest is above IDR 5,000,000. The third point is related to the parent ’ s occupation. Thirty- fi ve percent of the jobs parents of dropout students are entrepreneurs, 22 %   are civil servants, and the rest are others. In institutional factors, the points asked are related to the study program or   fi eld of study; 79 %   of dropout students  Academic program Social and economic Institutional Academic performance Personal Dropout students   Indirect interview Questionnaire  F   IGURE   3: The stage of seeking information directly from dropout students.

come from the engineering   fi eld, and others come from the study of humanities, math and natural science, economics, social science, art, and education, which is a tiny percentage. In academic performance factor, the points asked are CGPA. Fifty-seven percent of dropout students have a CGPA of 2.76 – 3.50, 28 %   have a CGPA of 2.00 – 2.75, and the rest are others. In personal factor, the   fi rst point is age; 49 %   of university dropouts aged 19 – 18 years, 40 %   of dropouts aged 29 – 38 years, and others older than that. The second point is gender; 82 %   of dropout students are male, and the rest are female. The third point is address; 50 %   of dropout students come from residency, 16 %   from the city, and the rest from others. Along with the   fi ve points discussed, student satisfaction with learning is also examined in detail. The points observed are the quality of lecturers, learning facilities, learning climate, assessment system, and relationships with staff/lecturers/aca- demic supervisors. The results of the questionnaire show that: (1) related to the quality of lecturers, the conclusion of the analysis is 75 % , meaning that according to dropout students, the lecturers who teach during lectures are   “ competent ” ; (2) learning facilities, the conclusion of the analysis is 70 % , meaning that students are satis fi ed with the learning facilities while undergoing lectures; (3) learning climate, the conclu- sion of the analysis is 71 % , meaning that according to dropout students, the learning climate that he got during university  “ supports ”   learning; (4) assessment system, the conclusion of the analysis is 72 % , which means that according to respon- dents, the assessment system when they study is transparent; (5) the relationship with staff/lecturers/academic supervisors, the conclusion of the analysis is 75 % , meaning that the respon- dent ’ s relationship with staff/lecturers/academic supervisors during learning is good. Another important point discussed in the questionnaire is why the student dropped out. The results of the questionnaire show that: (1) 48 %   of students dropout due to busy work, (2) 19 %   due to dif fi culties in doing theses, (3) 5 %   due to problems in participating in learning, (4) 9 %   due to moving study programs to other universities, (5) 4 %   because study programs do not match their interests, (6) 5 %   due to mar- riage, (7) 3 %   because the campus environment is not support- ive, and (8) others; the rest are sick or taking care of both parents. The reasons for these dropout students will be used as the basis for interviews to   fi nd their reasons in depth.  4.1.2. Step 2. Indirect Interviews.   Interviews were conducted to   fi nd out more about the reasons for dropping out. Dropout is a sensitive issue. Therefore, it is not easy to interview them directly. As a result, indirect interviews were conducted via chat/messenger. This interview is based on an explanation of why students dropped out in step 1. Data from interviews are analyzed using thematic analysis. The results of interviews with respondents obtained dropout students because: (1) Busy working: after conducting further interviews with respondents who dropped out because they were busy working, it was concluded that 31 %   of the respondents were busy working because of  fi nancial dif fi culties, and 69 %   had trouble managing their time. (2) Dif fi culty in doing thesis: the interview results showed that 52 %   of respondents had dif fi culty doing their the- sis because they were busy working, 38 %   of respon- dents had trouble doing their thesis because of the problem of research material, and 10 %   because of their stormy relationship with the supervisor. (3) Move study program to another university: interview results show that 90 %   of respondents move to other study programs at other universities because the study program does not match the respondent ’ s interests, and 10 %   is due to campus accreditation that is not in line with expectations. (4) Dif fi culty in the following lesson: interview results show that 83 %   of respondents have dif fi culty follow- ing learning due to wrong taking the study program, and 17 %   due to family problems. (5) Married: after respondents got married, they were too busy taking care of the household, so they did not have time to go to university. Of the 108 respon- dents, 69 %   were married, and 31 %   were single. (6) The study program does not match their interest: the results of the interviews showed that the study pro- gram taken was the parent ’ s choice and not their interest. (7) The campus environment is not supportive: after further interviews, 33 %   of respondents felt that the quality of the lecturers was unsatisfactory, and 67 %  of other respondents thought the campus bureau- cracy was very convoluted. (8) Others: respondents dropped out because they were sick, taking care of their parents, and moving domicile. Based on steps 1 and 2, several outline points can be con- cluded regarding the variables that affected student dropouts, including: (1) Students dropout because they are busy working, so they do not have time to go to the university to take care of their studies. So, it can be concluded that employment status is an essential variable affecting student dropouts. Apart from not dividing their time, another   fi nding was that the students were busy working due to a lack of   fi nances. This is closely related to parent income. Another possibility that affects students with   fi nancial de fi ciencies is individ- ual income. Parent income if the student is not mar- ried and individual income if the student is married. (2) The second biggest reason students leave the univer- sity before getting a degree are the dif fi culty of work- ing on a thesis. There are several reasons why students  fi nd it dif fi cult to do their thesis. First, they are busy working, so they do not have time to do their thesis. This strengthens the conclusion of the   fi rst point, which states that employment status is one of the most in fl uential variables to predict student dropout. 4   Education Research International 7592, 2023, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/7704142 by Cochrane Latvia, Wiley Online Library on [12/05/2025].

than 0.7. As a result, the current device, with a weight of 0.81, is extremely reliable. The reliability and separation items in Table 1 are 0.99 and 12.05, respectively. According to Table 1, the reliability of the items is 0.99, which is considered accept- able. While the separation of item 12.05, in which the instru- ment ’ s items can be classi fi ed into 16 levels based on the respondent ’ s level of dif fi culty, is approved. According to Bond and Fox [14] and Sumintono and Widhiarso [13], the separation index is greater than two, implying that it has a positive value. While the person generated has a reliability of 0.84, and the respondent separation is 2.26. As a result, the reliability test results obtained indicate that the respondents are also extremely reliable. Meanwhile, the respondent sepa- ration index of 2.26 is quite good, as it meets the minimum requirement ( > 2.0) for dividing respondents into three large groups. Additionally, the validity of the items is determined using the point correlation measure (PT-MEASURE CORR). This is the polarity of the item. The polarization item check is used to determine whether the constructed structure can achieve its objectives. If the PT-MEASURE CORR value is positive, the item can accurately measure what it is supposed to measure [14, 15]. If, on the other hand, the value is nega- tive, it indicates that the item was not developed to measure the construct being measured and, thus, must be revised or discarded. Once again, this is because the item is unfocused or dif fi cult for the respondent to answer. According to Table 2, each item (N1 – N9) has a positive PT-MEASURE CORR value. As a result, no item in the instrument was discarded simply because it met the bare minimum requirements. Addi- tionally, as shown in Table 2, the item 5 measure (N5) has a value of   + 0.89, indicating that it is the most dif fi cult item for respondents to answer. While item 6 (N6), with a value of  − 0.89, indicates the item that the respondent   fi nds the easiest to answer. Additionally, as shown in Table 2, all items have a high PT-MEASURE CORR value, indicating that they can dis- criminate between respondents ’   abilities. Suitability (item   fi t) is determined by the in fi t and out fi t mean square values (MNSQ), as shown in Table 2. As a result, MNSQ value obser- vations are required to ascertain whether the items developed are effective in measuring the construct latent variable. As a result, MNSQ value observations are required to ascertain whether the items developed effectively measure the con- structed latent variable. According to Rachman and Napitupulu [15], the in fi t and out fi t MNSQ parameters should be between 0.6 and 1.4 for data polytomy and between 0.7 and 1.3 for data dichotomy, respectively, to determine the suitability of the constructed item. As a result, out fi t MNSQ should be prioritized over in fi t MNSQ when assessing the suitability of measurement con- structs. Additionally, the ZSTD ( z   standard) values for the in fi t and out fi t received are in the range from   − 2.0 to 2.0. The ZSTD index, on the other hand, can be ignored if the in fi t and out fi t MNSQ values are obtained. According to Table 2, all items fall within the range of the in fi t and out fi t MNSQ limits for both dichotomy and polytomy items. Thus, according to the Rasch model, the instrument has a total of nine valid and reliable measurement items. Sumintono and Widhiarso [13] stated that if the person measure is greater than logit 0.0, it indicates a tendency for respondents who responded more frequently to agree on statements about various items. According to Table 1, the person measure has a value of 0.43. As a result, the average value exceeds logit 0.0. As a result, the respondents agree with the N1 – N9 statements. According to the overall inter- pretation of the Rasch model analysis, the public agrees that the variables affecting dropout students are the same as those identi fi ed in Section 4.1 (Figure 6).

factor consists of parents ’   income and marital status, in this case, called the family economic factor.  5. Discussion and Implications  Numerous variables contribute to the complexity of the causes of student dropouts in HE. This study aimed to determine what factors in fl uence dropout students at private universities in Indonesia, especially Central Java. Existing research shows that the factors affecting dropout students differ from country to country. Troelsen and Laursen ’ s [10] research also rein- forces this, which suggests that countries with different cul- tures have various assessments of the value of education. Therefore, the factors that in fl uence the success or failure of student studies are also other. Accordingly, the selection of variables that affect dropout students is adjusted to the coun- try ’ s circumstances. This research explores the reasons for dropout students directly from the dropout students in the Central Java region. Based on Sections 4.1 – 4.3, four factors in fl uence dropout students at private universities in Indonesia, as shown in Figure 7. The   fi rst factor is the personal economic factor, including individual income and employment status. Busy work and the inability to allocate time to complete college are signi fi cant reasons for student dropouts, especially if there is no   fi rm commitment to complete their studies. These results reinforce the   fi ndings in a previous research conducted by Amartayakul [19]. Students who simultaneously study and work have a high risk of dropping out. The most crucial factor, readiness to learn, is in fl uenced by individual full-time jobs that do not T ABLE   5: Sig. correlation test.

dropout students, and a quantitative approach is used to validate the   fi nding variables and classify the factors. This research step is considered very complex and long. The limi- tation of this research is that it is still done indirectly in the interview stage of dropout students. Researchers suggest that in further research, the interviews should be conducted directly. Another limitation of the stakeholder validation process is only using a questionnaire. We recommend that, at this stage, be added to the interview process with these stakeholders to provide input according to the conditions in each university.

4.2.2. Stakeholders Validation.   Dropout student data are sen- sitive data for a university. This is because dropout is one factor that affects the accreditation value of a university. Therefore, to claim that the variables found from Section 4.1 also affect student dropouts at universities in Central Java, stakeholder validation was carried out. The stakeholders in question are 17 rector or vice-rector for academics, 10 deans, and 23 heads of study programs from several private universities in Central Java. The stakeholder validation questionnaire is the same as the public opinion validation questionnaire. The Rasch model analysis using Winsteps software shows results, as shown in Table 3. The item reliability value from Table 3 shows that the value is 0.88, meaning that it is included in the excellent and accepted category. While the separation item ’ s value is 2.72, it can also be assumed to have a positive value because it is greater than 2. In addition, based on Table 3, the reliability of the person generated is 0.85, which means that the respondent has high reliability. Meanwhile, the value of the separation person is also good because the value is equal to 2.34. According to Table 4, each item (N1 – N9) has a positive PT-MEASURE CORR value. As a result, no instrument com- ponent is discarded simply because it complies with the minimum requirements. Additionally, as shown in Table 4, the value of the N8 measure item is   + 0.96, indicating that it is the most dif fi cult item for respondents to answer. While the value of the N6 measure item is   − 0.92, which means that the item is the item most easily answered by the respondent. As shown in Table 4, it can also be seen that all items have a high PT-MEASURE CORR value, so it can be concluded that these items can distinguish the respondents ’   abilities. Another important thing that can be concluded from Table 4 is that the limit value of in fi t MNSQ and out fi t MNSQ is between 0.6 and 1.4. As a result, the instrument has nine valid and reliable measurement items, as de fi ned by the Rasch model. From the overall interpretation of the analysis of the Rasch model, it can be concluded that stakeholders agree that the variables that affect students dropping out of the university are the same as the conclusions in Section 4.1 (Figure 6). Based on the results of the validation of public opinion and stakeholders, it can be concluded that it is true that the variables that affect dropout students are (1) employment status, (2) individual income, (3) parent income, (4) relationship lecturer/supervisor, (5) study program interest, (6) marital status, (7) CGPA, and (8) lecturer quality satisfaction.  4.3.   Classi fi cations   of   Variables.   This   third   step   utilizes CATPCA to classify these variables into dimension factors. The respondents were 329 students from a private university in Central Java, both dropouts and graduates in 2020. SPSS version 25.0 software was used for this step ’ s analysis. Before classifying variables, the   fi rst step is to clean the data. In this study, data cleaning was performed on missing values and noisy data. This study performed data cleaning on missing values and noisy data. Missing values are resolved using the median. Outlier detection uses casewise diagnostics to determine noise data. There are no missing values or noisy data; in this case, so the next step is data integration. The primary issue with data integration is redundancy. If a variable is   “ derived ”   from another variable, it is redundant. The correlation between the two variables is used to identify redundancy. The chi-square test determines the correlation between nominal and nominal and nominal and categorical data. Meanwhile, the Spearman test was used to determine categorical data with categorical data. The signi fi cance value of the correlation analysis of the analyzed variables is given in Table 5. According to Leech et al. [18], two variables are correlated if their signi fi cance value is   p < 0 : 5. From the results of the analysis, as shown in Table 5, there are several correlated variables, but these variables are not derived from one another. Therefore, although they are correlated, these variables are still used for the next analysis stage. The next step is to classify the variables using CATPCA. The number of variable classi fi cations is determined by the main component, which has an eigenvalue more than 1.

permit study time, lack of motivation to complete courses, lack of time to read course materials, and study fatigue. Pierrakeas et al. ’ s [6] research also strengthens this study ’ s results. Several factors were revealed by Pierrakeas related to variables that affect dropout students. However, in Pierrakea ’ s research, it is stated that employment status is a signi fi cant variable that affects dropout students. In addition to not dividing their time, another   fi nding was that students worked due to a lack of funds, and students with   fi nancial de fi ciencies were affected by individual income. In addition to not dividing their time, another   fi nding was that students were working due to a lack of funds; individual income affected students with   fi nancial de fi ciencies. The opin- ion of Contini and Zotti [20] con fi rmed this. The low income of individual students also has an impact on their academic success. Personal student income is more important than parental income to the student ’ s   fi nances. If the student is married, they no longer discuss parental support and instead discuss their income. This also affects their studies if they are unmarried and unable to manage their   fi nances properly. The second factor is academic satisfaction, including stu- dent relationships with lecturers/supervisors and lecturer quality satisfaction. In carrying out their duties and responsi- bilities, lecturers must be able to teach well. Lecturers who will teach are required to have pedagogic competence. Pedagogic competence is a person ’ s ability in the   fi eld of education. Student satisfaction with academic services is one thing that must be considered in implementing an education [21]. These  fi ndings strengthen the results of previous studies by Behr et al. [5], which explain that one factor in fl uencing dropout students is academic satisfaction, including student relationships with lecturers. Berens et al. ’ s [21] and Wiers-Jenssen et al. ’ s [22] research also supports that satisfaction with lecture quality affects dropout rates. The third factor is the academic performance factor that includes CGPA and program study interest. One of the criti- cal factors in the success of student study is academic ability. This academic ability is measured using CGPA. Poor aca- demic ability will result in the student failing to follow the lesson or not working on the thesis. This is also supported by Bujang et al. ’ s [23] research, which indicates that CGPA affects a student ’ s ability to complete a thesis. Furthermore, the implication is that CGPA is one of the variables that can predict student dropouts. These   fi ndings are the opinion of several experts in their research [9, 24 – 28]. In addition, the inability to adapt to the program and failure to select a pro- gram aligned with the student ’ s interests are notable factors in dropping out. From this, it can be concluded that interest in the study program is one of the key variables in fl uencing dropout students. This   fi nding is also supported by Ba ğ r ı ac ı k Y ı lmaz and Karata ş ’ s [29] research which states that study interest programs are one of the causes of student dropouts.

variable. The balance of component-based VAF values describes the eigenvalues ordered by the number of analysis variables. As shown in Table 6, there are four dimensions with eigenvalues greater than 1, meaning that the variables that affect dropout students are classi fi ed into four factor dimensions. Then, the next analysis uses the four dimensions of these factors, which can be seen in Table 7. The sum of the four components ’   VAF is 74.415 %   (Table 7), which means that the four dimensions of the grouping of eight ordinal and nominal variables show a good   fi t. VAF should be recognized as the primary criterion for selecting variables because it is crucial evidence of consistency between the principal components and measured variables. The variables were chosen from Table 8, taking the total VAF value into account. Variables with a total VAF of 25 %   or greater will be used for further analysis. As shown in Table 8, the combined VAF of all vari- ables is greater than 25 % , and, thus, all variables are included in the following analysis. Table 9 illustrates how variables are created from student dropout factor components. Component loading displays the Pearson correlation coef fi cient between the quanti fi ed vari- able and its central component between   − 1 and 1. This sym- bol indicates the relationship within the variable, and each component is either precisely positive or negative. From Table 9, the   fi rst-factor dimension consists of individual income and employment status, in this case, called the per- sonal economic factor. The second factor consists of relation- ship lecturer and supervisor and lecturer quality satisfaction, in this case, called the academic satisfaction factor. The third factor consists of CGPA and program study inter- est, in this case, called the academic factor.
