domain that scrutinizes educational data to uncover patterns, correla -  tions, and anomalies. The objective of this analysis is to deepen under -  standing and enhance decision-making within educational contexts. The EDM   process   typically   encompasses   several   stages,   including   data collection, pre-processing, transformation, model building, training, testing, and deployment [ 19 ].  The structure of the proposed procedures of the project is presented in   Fig. 1 , followed to materialize the visualization of student retention with demographic profile and academic performance data. The sec -  ondary data of CICS students were gathered from the Information and Communication Technology Center (ICTC) through the permission of the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs (OVCAA). The data requested was based on the findings from Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) [ 20 ] conducted beforehand. Then from the data source, it underwent CRISP-DM [ 21 ]. First, an in-depth analysis of the business objectives and needs was done. Next, the quality of the gathered data was examined and cleaned. Sub -  sequently, the data was organized for modeling. Ten (10) data modelling techniques   –   such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Multilayer   Perceptron   (MLP),   Decision   Tree,   Logistic   Regression, k-nearest Neighbour (kNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Gradient Boosting, and Naïve Bayes   –  were applied to predict the outcomes which were then evaluated using five (5) evaluation metrics   –   including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Mean Squared Error (MAE)   –   to identify the optimal model that provides the most accurate results which was implemented in creating the prediction. Power BI was then used to develop the analytical dashboard of student retention. Afterward, it was evaluated using the heuristic usability checklist of [ 22 ] same as the work of [ 23 ]. The pre -  dictive models, evaluation metrics, and academic factors — including grades from mathematics, programming, and other minor courses such as language-related subjects — along with sociodemographic indicators like age, sex, address, civil status, and parents ’   income used in this study, which can also be found in the work of [ 24 ]. That prior study high -  lighted a comprehensive set of models, metrics, and academic and sociodemographic   variables   that   have   been   widely   applied   across various studies focused on student retention.  3.2.   Software functionalities  Ensuring the academic success and persistence of students is a crit -  ical priority for universities and colleges. Effective student retention strategies   not   only   contribute   to   positive   outcomes   for   individual learners but also strengthen the overall institutional performance and reputation. To address this challenge, we developed a comprehensive student retention dashboard that leverages data-driven insights to sup -  port data-informed decision-making and targeted interventions.  The student retention dashboard or EduGuard RetainX is a powerful tool that integrates data from various sources across the institution to provide a comprehensive and holistic view of the student population. By seamlessly connecting to student information systems, academic re -  cords, and other relevant data repositories, the dashboard enables more informed and data-driven decision-making. One of the key strengths of the dashboard is its dynamic filtering and segmentation capabilities, allowing users to investigate specific subsets of the student body based on enrolment year, academic program, admission year, year level, and residency status. This level of customization empowers users to identify at-risk student populations and develop tailored support strategies.  The dashboard offers a panoramic overview of key student retention metrics, including enrolment trends, retention rates, dropout rates, and other critical performance indicators. Additionally, the detailed dropout analysis provides invaluable insights into the characteristics and aca -  demic performance of students who have discontinued their studies, informing targeted interventions and support strategies. To facilitate effective data exploration and communication, the dashboard leverages a diverse range of data visualization techniques, including pie charts, donut charts, stacked bar charts, clustered column charts, stacked col -  umn charts, map charts, and line and stacked column charts. These visually engaging and intuitive representations of the data empower users to identify patterns, draw insights, and effectively communicate findings to key stakeholders.  4.   Illustrative examples  The student retention dashboard offered by EduGuard RetainX is designed to empower users in identifying at-risk students, delivering targeted support, and assessing the effectiveness of institutional efforts to improve student success and retention. The dashboard ’ s sophisticated functionalities, showcased in the prototype ( Fig. 2 ), allow for intuitive exploration with dynamic filters such as enrolment year, student ID, program, admission year, year level, and residency status. This level of customization enhances the versatility of the dashboard, enabling users to tailor their analysis to specific student populations.  The dashboard provides a comprehensive suite of data visualization tools, including pie charts, donut charts, stacked bar charts, clustered column charts, stacked column charts, map charts, and line and stacked column charts, to ensure a holistic understanding of the data. Users can leverage these visuals to examine key retention metrics on the overall  Fig. 1.   Process design of student retention analytical dashboard.  N.J. Dia et al.

data filtration, and alerts for sudden occurrences [ 2 ]. Similarly, the CitrusYield dashboard by [ 3 ], created using R software, enhances crop management by providing detailed information on yields and relevant farming processes. In business, dashboards enable organizations to track performance and create Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), improving decision-making and communication among employees [ 4 ]. With the help of Power BI and provided with quality datasets, different de -  partments can summarize, visualize, and filter data according to their specific needs reducing the time spent on redundant visualizations and the   interpretation   of   results.   Dashboards   not   only   enhance decision-making abilities but also improve work efficiency, and pro -  ductivity [ 5 ]. In education, interactive dashboards analyze students ’  facial expressions during online lectures, helping educators tailor course recommendations and improve operational efficiency [ 6 ]. Additionally, [ 7 ] identified that dashboards help educators in monitoring student engagement and performance levels assisting in the early identification of potential issues, thereby allowing for timely corrective measures, when necessary, which may, in turn, contribute to improved academic performance among students. Generally, dashboards enhance manage -  ment,   productivity,   and   student   learning   outcomes   across   diverse domains.  Recent years have seen a growing emphasis on improving student retention in higher education institutions [ 8 ] due to its direct impact on university rankings, reputation, and financial health [ 9 ]. Various studies have shown factors influencing a student ’ s withdrawal, failure, or course performance are complex, with socio-demographic and academic variables playing pivotal roles in retention studies [ 10 – 12 ]. To tackle these challenges, institutions can leverage Educational Data Mining (EDM) and machine learning to diagnose student weaknesses, predict performance issues, and anticipate future progress [ 13 ], ultimately enhancing   institutional   effectiveness   and   the   learning environment [ 14 ].  Despite the recognized importance of student retention, the Mind -  anao State University-Main Campus, specifically the College of Infor -  mation and Computing Sciences (CICS), faces significant challenges with a high attrition rate. This issue is exacerbated by the absence of robust decision-making tools to identify and analyse the factors influencing student performance and withdrawal [ 14 – 16 ]. Decision-makers or the local admission officers of the college currently lack the means to sys -  tematically   evaluate   student   outcomes   and   predict   withdrawal probabilities.  Our initiative is to investigate and identify the crucial elements that influence students ’   decisions to withdraw in response to this urgent necessity. Our goal in creating the application is to enable decision- makers to comprehend and analyse pertinent data, which will help them discover critical areas that need to be addressed to lower student attrition. Power BI was used to construct an interactive and user-friendly dashboard, and machine learning methods written in Python will be used for the analysis. Additionally, the main goal is to provide decision- makers with an effective tool that will enable them to precisely forecast the likelihood of a student withdrawing based on the elements that have been found to impact student retention such as academic performance, particularly mathematics and programming subjects, program, admis -  sion test score, and Grade Point Average (GPA); sociodemographic background, including age and sex; thereby promoting a more encour -  aging and productive learning environment.  This paper presents the development of an interactive dashboard designed to generate reports on student academic and sociodemo -  graphic data. The data collected serves as a basis for predicting the withdrawal rate of individual students within the college context. Additionally, dashboards function as an effective tool for organizations to consolidate complex information into a single interface, thereby facilitating the quick and efficient interpretation of analyses [ 17 ].  3.   Software description  The EduGuard RetainX followed a thorough process design involving data gathering, cleaning, and modelling using machine learning algo -  rithms to predict student withdrawal probability. The resulting dash -  board prototype offers a sophisticated analytical tool, providing a panoramic view of essential metrics, detailed analysis of the dropout population, and a focused exploration of individual student perfor -  mance.   Moreover,   the   dashboard   features   dynamic   filters,   diverse visualization tools, and a student details page with risk score categori -  zation, as well as a retention page that predicts student dropout prob -  ability to enable targeted interventions. Hence, the student retention software represents a significant step forward in addressing the chal -  lenges   of   student   attrition.   By   empowering   decision-makers   with insightful data visualizations and predictive analytics, the software al -  lows institutions to identify struggling students, understand the factors contributing   to   withdrawal,   and   implement   effective   strategies   to improve retention rates. The positive usability evaluation of the soft -  ware of 89 % confirms its utility and effectiveness in monitoring student retention within the CICS, underscoring the practical application of data-driven solutions in enhancing student success and institutional effectiveness in tertiary education.  EduGuard RetainX is an interactive dashboard specifically designed to generate reports on student academic and socio-demographic data while predicting withdrawal rates of students in College of Information and   Computing   Sciences.   By   consolidating   complex   and   extensive datasets into a unified interface, this tool enhances the rapid and effi -  cient   interpretation   of   analyses,   enabling   college   administrators, including department heads and undergraduate program coordinators, to effectively address the critical issue of student retention. The dash -  board was created using Microsoft ’ s Power BI due to its powerful fea -  tures, such as having its own data warehouse to help easily manipulate the data being imported, for instance, from a flat file. Another is that it is easy to create, modify, and import intuitive visuals. Aside from dis -  playing student information, this software is capable of predicting the withdrawal probability of individual students based on their current data. It was made possible by writing the code of the machine learning algorithm that was optimal in predicting retention in Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) in Power BI environment.  3.1.   Software architecture  This research used the concepts of learning analytics and Educational Data Mining (EDM) to analyze the gathered data and construct an interactive dashboard.  Learning analytics is defined as the measurement, collection, anal -  ysis, and reporting of data of learners and their contexts [ 17 ]. Its primary aim is to enhance understanding and optimize both the learning process and the environments in which it occurs. This definition is frequently cited in related disciplines, including educational data mining, academic analytics, recommender systems, and personalized adaptive learning. Moreover, [ 18 ] further elaborates on this definition, characterizing learning analytics as "the use of intelligent data, learner-produced data, and analysis models to discover information and social connections, as well as to predict and advise on learning." Within the realm of learning analytics, student interventions are often realized through dashboards that visually represent student data. These visualizations facilitate stu -  dents in monitoring their academic progress and adapting their learning strategies as needed. Furthermore, dashboards can be designed for ed -  ucators, enabling them to identify students who may be at risk of dropping out or encountering academic difficulties. Consequently, the development of a well-structured learning analytics dashboard is critical for empowering students to take charge of their own educational jour -  neys. This tool should also aid educators in recognizing at-risk students or those exhibiting signs of low performance [ 18 ].  On the other hand, Educational Data Mining (EDM) is a specialized  N.J.

personalized support to students who are most vulnerable to attrition. This shift from a one-size-fits-all approach to a tailored, student-centric model has the potential to dramatically improve retention rates and student outcomes across the board.  Furthermore, the platform ’ s intuitive visualization tools empower a broader range of stakeholders, from academic advisors to student ser -  vices professionals, to actively participate in the retention strategy. By democratizing access to these critical insights, the software fosters a collaborative,   data-driven   culture   within   the   institution,   where everyone can contribute to student success initiatives. The effectiveness of the EduGuard RetainX software, as demonstrated through rigorous usability evaluations, underscores its transformative impact and the tangible benefits it can deliver to both students and institutions. Beyond the immediate impact on student retention, the widespread adoption of this platform has the potential to reshape the higher education land -  scape, inspiring a broader cultural shift towards evidence-based prac -  tices   and   a   relentless   focus   on   student   success.   By   empowering institutions to make more informed, data-driven decisions, the Edu -  Guard RetainX software can catalyze a transformative influence that ripples across the educational ecosystem, setting a new standard for data-driven approaches to student retention and overall institutional success.  This dashboard enables students to identify areas for improvement and take actionable steps based on personalized learning recommen -  dations tailored to individual needs. Furthermore, by offering engaging visualizations and facilitating early intervention for at-risk students, the system fosters self-regulated learning and informed decision-making. The integration of learning analytics dashboards in educational set -  tings underscores their significant role in optimizing learning outcomes and promoting student success [ 25 ]. The dashboard also serves as a tool for instructors to conduct a thorough analysis of student-related data. It enables the identification of individuals who may face challenges in completing their degrees, thereby addressing the significant issues of student retention and academic performance within the institution [ 26 ]. Together with college administrators, specifically, the chairpersons and the dean, EduGuard RetainX facilitates the early identification of stu -  dents at risk of course failure and establishes a robust empirical foun -  dation for interventions initiated by both educators and administrators. Such interventions — including advising students to shift or strategize to enhance performance in specific subjects — have the potential to signif -  icantly improve learning outcomes and enhance student retention rates [ 27 ]. The dashboard significantly impacts all stakeholders — students, instructors, and administrators — by offering a comprehensive overview of pertinent data to support them in informed decision-making aimed at addressing the issue of student retention.  6.   Model evaluation  Following the preprocessing of data, the dataset was segmented into training for seventy percent (70 %) and testing for thirty percent (30 %) data. Subsequently, various models were trained using the training data to   train   them   in   prediction.   The   evaluation   metrics   revealed   that Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) is the most optimal for predicting student retention of CICS. The tabular data together with the confusion matrix below presents the individual scores of the models. As observed in the   Table 1 , the model with the highest accuracy score (93 %     94 %) and lowest error score (6.21 %) is XGBoost.  These results align with [ 28 ] who demonstrated XGBoost ’ s superi -  ority over logistic regression models like IRT, PFA, and DAS3H across eight educational datasets. XGBoost improved PFA ’ s predictive accuracy (AUC up to 0.88) and optimized DAS3H ’ s performance on the ASSIST -  ment17 dataset. Similarly, [ 29 ] explored XGBoost alongside Random Forest in Educational Data Mining (EDM) and found that both algo -  rithms effectively identified critical factors influencing academic out -  comes, though XGBoost often excelled in predictive tasks. Additionally, [ 30 ]   compared   regression   models   like   SVR,   RFR,   AdaBoost,   and XGBoost for predicting student performance and graduate employment waiting periods. Although SVR and RFR excelled in specific tasks, XGBoost was competitive across different scenarios, showcasing its versatility.  Further, these studies emphasize XGBoost ’ s strengths in handling nonlinear relationships, imbalanced data, and overfitting prevention through regularization, making it a highly reliable tool for predictive tasks and data-driven decision-making in education. This reinforces its value in building early warning systems for student retention and highlights its robustness in educational predictive tasks.  7.   Dashboard evaluation  The dashboard was assessed using [ 22 ] ’ s Heuristics Evaluation Checklist for Dashboard Visualizations. This checklist comprises ten usability principles, detailed in the   Table 2 , and is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the system in fulfilling its intended purposes and objectives. A cohort of ten faculty members from the College of Infor -  mation and Computing Sciences was selected using convenience sam -  pling to complete the checklist, ensuring a comprehensive evaluation of the dashboard ’ s usability.  It can be seen in   Fig. 3   that the dashboard ’ s usability almost met the maximum scores (perfect score) in all principles. Further, the total result of the evaluation indicates an average usability score of 89 %, suggesting that the analytical dashboard demonstrates a solid level of usability. However, certain areas require further enhancement to optimize the user experience. Feedback from respondents indicates that the system effectively supports the monitoring of student retention within the College of Information and Computing Sciences ( Fig. 4 ).
