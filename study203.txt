A systematic review  Magda Elena Samoila* and Tina Vrabie  Faculty of Psychology and Education Sciences, Alexandru Ioan Cuza University, Iasi, Romania  Introduction:   Vincent Tinto is a towering figure in the study of dropout in higher education whose theory regarding student departure is a widely accepted contribution   that   explains   how   students   become   involved   in   the   academic community and how their level of engagement impacts their decision to persist or to drop out. The aim of this study is to advance understanding of how Vincent Tinto’s theories influence the current practices and support services offered by higher education institutions to freshman students through first-year seminars (FYS).  Methods:   A systematic review was conducted based on peer-reviewed articles published between 2020 and 2022, selected through a multi-stage process. With reference to Tinto’s contribution, this systematic review aims at providing answers to the following research questions: What are the methodological approaches identified in the studies under analysis? What knowledge can be identified in recent studies related to the categories of students attending FYS? What knowledge about students’ personal and psychological characteristics with relevance for FYS can be found in recent studies? What knowledge about academic pedagogical and counseling factors with relevance for FYS can be found in recent studies? What knowledge about social and relational factors integration with relevance for FYS can be found in recent studies?  Results:   The findings indicate three categories of studies that capitalize on Tinto’s theories with regard to the design, conduct and evaluation of first-year seminars: a. studies that assess the role of students’ personal and psychological variables, considered within FYS; b. studies that analyze the pedagogical and counseling interventions destined to students within FYS; c. studies that analyze the role of the social and relational dimension within FYS.  Discussion:   The literature on the topic capitalizes on Vincent Tinto’s contributions in relation to a student corpus which is extremely diverse in terms of age, socio-economic status, racial and cultural characteristics, attended specialization (a significant number of studies are destined to students who attend STEM specializations),   generational   characteristics   (the   example   of   first-generation students). Therefore, the interventions aimed at facilitating the integration of first- year students are carefully tailored and customized according to the needs of these categories of beneficiaries.

Procedure according to the PRISMA statement ( Moher et al., 2009 ).  the discussion of the results, being to quantify and analyze these contributions and associate them with the research questions of this study. These more selective search criteria were applied by the two researchers so that, at the end of the verification stage, the database reached 50 articles. However, after reading the full texts, we concluded that only 23 of them met the eligibility criteria in line with the research questions. It should also be noted that, although the search criteria focused on texts written in English, one article written in Spanish ( Calamet, 2020 ) was also identified, consulted and maintained in the list, as its content could be read and understood by the two reviewers. Furthermore, we kept on the list two other articles ( Longwell-Grice and Longwell-Grice, 2007– 2008 ;   Neuville et al., 2007 ) that approach the issue of FYS starting from studies that either revisit or complete Vincent Tinto’s theories. Therefore, the full texts were read several times with a strict focus   on   a   specific   research   question.   With   the   help   of   the knowledge organization functions of the reference management software ZOTERO (tag function) we were able to collect answers to the research questions. The general review procedure was based on PRISMA statement of   Moher et al.   ( 2009 ). Also, we used PRISMA 2020 flow diagram for updated systematic reviews which included searches of databases only.   Figure 1   illustrates the stages of the reviewing process.  Analytical strategy  The selected articles were distributed to the authors, each of the authors performing a preliminary analysis of the articles allocated to her. In this preliminary stage, the authors used a coding table that included the following categories: the nature of the study (assessment of the empirical nature of the study), Tinto’s contribution (using bibliographical information), authors’ geographical origin, goals of the FYS intervention (whether the interventions target the paedagogical and counseling dimension, the social and relational dimension of the students’ personal characteristics). For the final analysis of the selected articles ( n  =   23) we used the NVivo 12 analysis software. The articles were coded according to the categories defined in the preliminary analysis. This analysis stage took 8 days, and the ourcome of the process was a more nuanced and trustworthy analysis, as the authors collaboratively coded the data by discussing their individual classifications and reached a shared understanding. It also resulted a list of 23 articles by Vincent Tinto ( Appendix 2 ) consulted by the authors investigated during this review, plus two studies that review or complement Vincent Tinto’s theories ( Longwell-Grice and Longwell-Grice, 2007–2008 ;   Neuville et al., 2007 ). The next section presents the results according to our research questions.  Results  The findings provide an overview of how Vincent Tinto’s theoretical   contributions   to   ensuring   an   effective   university transition are being used in recent studies on the issue of support services offered to students during FYS. All 23 reviewed articles are listed in   Appendix 1   and specific information about the objectives of the studies and the methodology adopted by the authors are identified in   Table 1 . The results of this review will be presented according to the research questions. Following on from the thematic analysis the results of the review were broken down into the key themes outlined in the coding tables. This part of the article will explore the   general   evidence   relating   to   these   themes.   Consequently, we’ll explore the reviewed papers according to: the nature of the study, the categories of students approached by the authors, student’s personal and psychological characteristics, the criterion of pedagogical and counseling interventions targeted within the FYS, and the criterion related to social and relational interventions targeted in FYS.  Analyses of review papers according to the nature of the study (empirical, theoretical or review study)  The results of an initial categorization of studies in empirical ( n   =   20), theoretical ( n   =   2) or review studies ( n   =   1) are detailed in   Table 2 .  Analysis of reviewed papers according to the categories of students approached by the authors  We have also identified a number of studies that analyze the profile of students participating in programmes delivered through FYS, aimed at delivering customized tailored services to various categories of students ( Table 3 ). It should also be specified that some of these studies are not limited to the analysis of a single dimension, but instead treat these dimensions in interaction ( Schulzetenberg  Frontiers in   Education   03   frontiersin.org

Yet another limitation is that in the   ∼ 2 months between the registration of the articles (December 2022) and the completion and submission of the text for review (February 2023) other contributions were published that were not included in this analysis. Furthermore, the final number of studies included in our analysis is quite limited. In this sense, it can be challenging to draw strong conclusions about the effectiveness of the topics and approaches used in FYS that make use of Vincent Tinto’s contributions. Future research approaches might consider the need for additional studies to supplement the existing evidence base.  Conclusion  Interpreting   Vincent   Tinto’s   contributions   in   the   light   of current research, we are entitled to assert that they are intensively used and form the basis of numerous studies that particularize the role and nature of interventions provided by universities according to different types of beneficiaries; student personal and psychological characteristics; pedagogical and counseling; and social and relational. Tinto’s work has helped to shape our understanding of student retention and dropout in higher education, and his ideas have been widely adopted by educators and policy makers working to improve student success. There are a number of strategies that universities can use to help students feel more integrated, including: 1. Orientation and registration programs/FYS: These programs help students to become familiar with the campus and resources, and to meet other students and faculty (social and relational dimension); 2. Academic advising: Providing students with academic advising can help them to feel more connected to the institution and to develop a sense of purpose and direction in their studies (pedagogical and counseling dimension); 3. Social support: Providing students with access to social support, such as counseling services or peer mentorship programs, can help them to feel more connected to the institution and to build a sense of belonging (pedagogical and counseling dimension & social and relational dimension); 4. Involvement in academic and social activities: Encouraging students to get involved in academic and social activities on campus can help them to feel more connected to the institution and to build relationships with their peers (pedagogical and counseling dimension & social and relational dimension). This literature review provided important and comprehensive information and can have practical implications for researchers, designers, and providers of services for freshman students through FYS in terms of aims, content, providers, recipients, and social and pedagogical approaches. Although, at the same time, Vincent Tinto’s theoretical contributions may not account for the diversity of student experiences and backgrounds. Students from different socioeconomic, cultural, and ethnic backgrounds may face unique challenges that are not fully captured by the au-thor. Tinto’s theoretical   contributions   places   too   much   emphasis   on   the student as individuality and his ability to integrate into the university environment, without fully considering the broader structural factors that may impact student success. For example, issues related to access to resources, institu-tional policies, and societal inequalities may play a significant role in student success and retention. In conclusion, while Vincent Tinto’s theoretical contributions have provided valuable insights into the factors that contribute to student success and retention, it has also been criticized for being too simplistic and failing to account for the complex and varied motivations that drive student be-havior. It is important to consider a range of factors and perspectives when examining student re-tention and success in higher education. Though in need of further research, the practical implications of the current findings might be helpful in examining the factors underlying student retention and success in higher education also through the lenses of another variables, like the complex and varied motivations that drive student behavior.

Samoila and Vrabie   10.3389/feduc.2023.1205667  Introduction  This systematic review aims at identifying the way in which Vincent Tinto’s theoretical contributions are used to integrate students into the university environment and to prevent dropouts through the activities carried out during the first-year seminars (FYS). Vincent Tinto is an influential American sociologist, well- known for his work on student retention and dropout in higher education. Tinto’s theories of student departure/interactive model of student departure represent a widely accepted contribution that explains how students become involved in the academic community and how their level of engagement impacts on their decision   to   persist   or   drop   out   ( Tinto,   1975 ,   1987 ).   Tinto’s integrative theory of college student retention also addresses the issue of student attrition, or the process of students leaving or dropping out of college ( Tinto, 1988 ). Tinto argues that student attrition is not a one-time event, but rather a process that begins with the student’s decision to attend college and continues through their enrollment ( Tinto, 1987 ). According to   Tinto   ( 1975 ,   1982 ,   1987 ), students are more likely to persist in college and graduate if they are academically and socially integrated into the institution. Integration into the academic community refers to the extent to which a student feels connected to and supported by their peers and faculty, is engaged in the life of the institution, both inside and outside of the classroom ( Tinto, 2005 ).   Tinto   ( 2017a , b ) argues that there are three factors that conditions students’ integration in their first academic year:   the   students’   personal   and   psychological   characteristics, academic factors (pedagogy and counseling-related) and social and relational factors. In Vincent Tinto’s interactive model of student departure, the psychological and personal characteristics refer to the individual factors that influence a student’s decision to persist or drop-out of college/university ( Tinto, 1975 ,   1987 ). Academic integration, which includes factors such as academic counseling, the quality of instruction, and the relevance of coursework to the student’s educational and career goals, is a pre-condition of students’ academic success ( Engle and Tinto, 2008 ). Tinto argues that institutions should provide appropriate levels of support, using pedagogical strategies in order to facilitate student transition. Social integration includes factors such as interaction with peers and faculty staff, as well as a sense of belonging to the institution, which can ensure the connection between that particular institution and its students. Recent literature consistently builds on the author’s theoretical framework in order to streamline the way these activities are organized, conducted and evaluated to facilitate students’ transition into the university environment through FYS. The first academic year   is   fundamental,   as   this   is   the   time   when   the   students establish   (or   fail   to   establish)   their   self-efficacy   and   positive role models that will guide their behavior and learning habits. The concept of first-year seminars refers to the introductory courses organized by universities to facilitate the integration of first-year students and familiarize them with the main skills to be developed and with the supporting university community (faculty, administration, other students) ( Aulck et al., 2021 ;   Jenert and Brahm, 2021 ). Freshman seminar courses draw on broader educational retention theory and the impact social integration has upon the persistence of students’ academic trajectories ( Tinto, 1987 ). The rationale of the review in the context of existing literature is to advance understanding of how Vincent Tinto’s theory of student departure   influences   the   contemporary   knowledge,   practices and student support offered by higher education institutions to freshman students through FYS. A systematic review was conducted of 23 peer-reviewed studies published in the period between 2020 and 2022. With   reference   to   Tinto’s   contribution,   this   systematic review   aims   at   providing   answers   to   the   following   research questions (RQs): RQ1. What are the methodological approaches identified in the studies under analysis? RQ2. What knowledge can be identified in recent studies related to the categories of students attending FYS? RQ3.   What   knowledge   about   students’   personal   and psychological characterstics with relevance for FYS can be found in recent studies? RQ4.   What   knowledge   about   academic   pedagogical   and counseling factors with relevance for FYS can be found in recent studies? RQ5. What knowledge about social and relational factors integration   with   relevance   for   FYS   can   be   found   in recent studies?  Method  Search and selection  This section will outline the review process, which consisted of searches and selection strategies. Bibliographic information was collected from Scopus database and the investigation period was set from 2020 to 2022. It was decided to start the entire process in advanced search to circumscribe the object of study as precisely as possible. The articles that we selected met the following criteria: (a) they appeared in a peer-reviewed journal, (b) they were written in English, (c) they were published between 2020 and December 2022, and (d) they reported studies aimed at promoting students services through FYS by means of a practical intervention, starting from Vincent Tinto’s theoretical contributions. In the initial screening, all articles were reviewed in terms of whether their titles, abstracts, and keywords matched our inclusion criteria. This particular search string created 118 hints. These articles were screened based on their titles, abstracts and keywords. During the screening, exclusion criteria were set to eliminate articles that did not match our research questions. The search aimed to identify the two terms, namely  first-year seminars   and   Vincent Tinto   at title, abstract and keyword level. Of the 118 articles that we identified, only 100 contained the phrase FYS in their title, abstract or keywords. As none of these reviewed articles explicitly contained Vincent Tinto’s name, the search progressed and the full text of the studies was consulted. Thus, references to Tinto’s contributions in the text of the article and in the references were identified, our subsequent aim, in  Frontiers in   Education   02   frontiersin.org

( 1994 ), and   Neuville et al.

Schulzetenberg et al., 2020  Tinto   ( 1993 ,   2012b )   FYS conceived as a pre-academic programme aimed at emphasiying the diversity of students-students and students-teachers interactions.  Van Herpen et al., 2020  identify the specific elements that have an impact on the categories of students enrolled in FYS. First of all, we clearly note that the literature on the topic capitalizes on Vincent Tinto’s contributions in relation to a student corpus which is extremely diverse in terms of age, socio-economic status, racial and cultural characteristics, attended specialization (a significant number of studies are destined to students who attend STEM specializations), generational characteristics (the example of first-generation students). Therefore, the interventions aimed at facilitating the integration of first-year students are carefully tailored and customized according to the needs of these categories of beneficiaries. Furthermore, in relation to the students’ characteristics analyzed in the studies we reviewed, we note that there are authors who argue that personalized interventions at the FYS level should benefit not only first-time students, but also those who have re-enrolled after a drop-out phase or those who have transferred to other specializations ( Beasley et al., 2020 ). Secondly,   we   noted   that   the   three   dimensions   (personal, paedagogical and counseling, social and relational characteristics) proposed   by   Tinto   to   explain   and   enable   the   integration   of students   into   the   academic   environment   were   analyzed   and developed in all the studies that made the subject of our analysis. However, studies that emphasize the role of tailored counseling sessions in universities and campuses prevail. Of increased interest was to note the diversity of counseling sessions. Some authors distinguish between counseling sessions according to the place where these sessions are held (both the formal academic context and the non-formal context—student campuses or even the local community) ( Schulzetenberg et al., 2020 ). Furthermore, there are authors who approach the counseling sessions in terms of their different contents (from sessions incorporating elements of cultural and linguistic diversity, to psychological counseling with a role in identifying the behavioral intentions that indicate the risk of drop-out, to counseling through music) ( Andrade et al., 2020 ;   Whittinghill et al., 2021 ). Other authors refer to the categories of people who initiate counseling (from counselors who receive specific training to interact with first-year students to counseling provided by students enrolled in student associations, fraternities,   or   alumni)   ( Alshuaybat,   2021 ;   Lee   et   al.,   2022 ). There are also authors who refer to the temporal dimension of counseling, distinguishing between initial counseling sessions aimed at first-year students and intrusive sessions aimed at helping counselors identify first-year students in difficulty and address them as early as possible ( Shaaban and Reda, 2022 ). In terms of the pedagogical approaches suitable for FYS, the studies we analyzed revealed that the interventions pertain to issues such as: types of teaching methods, aspects related to the size of the student groups, classroom design, the manner in which interventions are adapted to the heterogeneity and homogeneity of the group, as well as students’ awareness with regard to remedial activities provided by the university. As far as the paedagogical content is concerned, studies analyzing the importance of developing specific skills such as time management, formation of study habits and note-taking are predominant ( Leary et al., 2020 ;   Stephen and Rockinson-Szapkiw, 2021 ). The social and relational dimension is analyzed by the authors of studies investigating the role of the diversity of interactions established by first-year students with faculty members, upper-year students, alumni and community members ( Van Herpen et al., 2020 ;   Aulck et al., 2021 ;   Santana et al., 2022 ). Our findings highlight the affordances of peer-to-peer teaching and intergenerational approaches. The authors address issues related to the role of student engagement in learning communities both in academic contexts and on student campuses ( Qvortrup and Lykkegaard, 2022 ). A series of studies argue that volunteer activities and even part- time community engagement for students with low socio-economic status remove the risk of dropping out in the first year of study ( Schulzetenberg et al., 2020 ). There   are,   however,   certain   limitations   to   our   approach. The quality of the studies that we reviewed was not evaluated. Rather than being a critical review of the state of the research methodologies and results, the aim of our review was actually to describe and discuss the topics and approaches used in FYS that make use of Vincent Tinto’s contributions. Although the number of studies is limited to 23, we consider that the results obtained are significant for the topic addressed due to the in- depth analysis that aimed at the full consultation of the articles, the identification of the answers to the research questions, and the theoretical contributions of Vincent Tinto embodied in the bibliographic references of the analyzed articles. Another limitation of the study is that we consulted only the Scopus database and consequently were unable to perform a comparative and critical  Frontiers in   Education   08   frontiersin.org

Analysis of reviewed paper according student’s personal and psychological charactersitics  In Vincent Tinto’s interactive model of student departure, the psychological and personal characteristics refer to the individual factors that influence a student’s decision to persist or drop out of college/university ( Tinto, 1975 ,   1987 ). Among the psychological characteristics   that   may   contribute   to   student   departure   we should mention: (1) Academic preparedness: students who struggle academically may be more likely to drop out if they do not feel capable of keeping up with the college-specfic academic demands; (2) Motivation: students who are not motivated to succeed academically or who do not see the value in completing their degree may be more likely to drop out; (3) Commitment: students who are not committed to completing their degree may be more likely to drop out. Starting   from   Tinto’s   theories,   we   identified   a   series   of studies that approach the following personal and psychological characteristics of students, from the perspective of easier access to FYS: students’ past and their previous learning experiences with a focus on their achievements in previous examinations ( Van Herpen et al., 2020 ;   Jenert and Brahm, 2021 ); affective, motivational and cognitive variables ( Calamet, 2020 ;   Eichler and Gradwohl, 2021 ;  Jenert and Brahm, 2021 ); anxieties caused by the transition into a new learning context, perceived as difficult and the students’ perceptions of their own training for this stage of study ( Beasley et al., 2020 ;   Van Herpen et al., 2020 ;   Whittinghill et al., 2021 ;  Archbell and Coplan, 2022 ); aspects related to the self-directed nature of learning, self-regulation, self-direction and self-efficacy of learning, goal commitment, study habits, and learning preferences ( Stephen and Rockinson-Szapkiw, 2021 ); Psychological barriers to engagement ( Beasley et al., 2020 ), such as help-seeking stigma and learned helplessness and to a sense of belonging ( Van Herpen et al., 2020 ;   Cooper, 2021 ). Relevant data is presented in   Table 4 .  Analysis of reviewed paper according to the criterion of pedagogical and counseling interventions targeted within the FYS  Tinto’s work has helped to shape our understanding of student retention and dropout in higher education, and his ideas have been widely adopted by educators and policy makers working to improve student success. In this regard, the role of the classroom and classroom practice in student retention/succes is also explored. Variables such as the impact of pedagogy, the impact of assessment, the impact of counseling sessions ( Tinto, 1997 ) should also be considered in relation to the ways in which classroom practice shapes student retention and succes ( Tinto, 2010 ).

Relevant data is presented in   Table 5 . Studies that address student counseling activities with a role in ensuring student integration, retention and success include: counseling   strategies   for   linguistic   and   cultural   development ( Andrade   et   al.,   2020 );   peer   group   counseling,   optimizing interactions between teaching staff and students; counseling offered at the level of student associations, counseling to successfully manage   non-academic   contexts   (campuses,   fraternities,   local community, etc.) ( Lee et al., 2022 ); Special training sessions for counselors working with first-year students ( Alshuaybat, 2021 ); counseling students who passed the admission examinations with low average grades and were identified as having low motivation to study because they major in disciplines they are not interested in ( Calamet, 2020 ); intrusive counseling sessions that refer to the fact that the counselors’ tasks are not based on the idea of waiting for students to ask for help, but on identifying and addressing them as early as possible ( Shaaban and Reda, 2022 ); counselors of First-Generation College Students (FGS) who value the influence of music on identifying and managing emotions of anxiety and insecurity generated by the transition into a new educational environment ( Whittinghill et al., 2021 ) and mentoring activities that address issues of respect for student diversity, along with an anti-racism policy that involves engaging students in both formal and campus-based activities ( Ajayi et al., 2021 );   Table 6   summarizes these studies by considering the contributions of Vincent Tinto.  Analysis of reviewed paper according to the criterion related to social and relational interventions targeted in FYS  Tinto   ( 2003 ,   2017a ) argues that students’ perceptions of their social integration into the institution represent an important factor in their persistence. This means that students who feel connected to their peers and feel satisfied with their educational experience tend to persist ( Tinto, 2017a ). Thus, students who feel isolated or unsupported by their peers and faculty, or who do not feel engaged in the life of the institution, are more likely to drop out. On large college campuses, freshmen often feel as though they do not have a personalized identity (i.e., they see themselves as another “face in the crowd”) while feeling overwhelmed by the competitive higher education environment ( Sullivan and Wulff, 1990 ). Consequently, social engagement helps students feel more connected to the campus community and more satisfied with the college experience overall while helping them feel less isolated as learners ( Tinto, 2003 ). Based on Vincent Tinto’s theoretical contributions, we have identified in the corpus of studies we reviewed the following concerns   of   the   authors   related   to   the   social   and   relational dimension in the organization and conduct of FYS: students’ involvement in learning communities ( Aulck et al., 2021 ) and in   first-year   students’   interest   groups   ( Santana   et   al.,   2022 ); Involvement of under-represented and low socio-economic status students in short-term, part-time volunteering and employment on campus and in the local community ( Schulzetenberg et al., 2020 ); students’ participation in pre-academic programmes to familiarize them with various student-student/student-teacher interactions ( Van Herpen et al., 2020 ).   Tinto’s   ( 1997 ) theoretical contributions related to the role of learning communities in increasing student participation and engagement inside and outside the classroom are complemented by   Freire   ( 2000 ) contributions and used for the purpose of integrating marginalized groups in order to ensure  Frontiers in   Education   06   frontiersin.org

There are also studies that focus on the interaction between factors related to the social and academic environment ( Qvortrup and Lykkegaard, 2022 ) whereas some other authors target the interaction between the social and the personal factors—one such example is the PECS model (purpose, expectations, connections, support) proposed by   Cooper   ( 2021 ). Relevant data is presented in   Table 7 . During the investigation of papers included in our systematic review we found that the studies we analyzed used a total of 23 articles authored and published by Vincent Tinto between 1975 and 2017 ( Appendix 2 ).  Discussion  To advance understanding of how Vincent Tinto’s theoretical contributions   are   used   in   integrating   students   in   the   higher education environment and in preventing student departure with the help of activities carried out during first-year seminars (FYS) we conducted a systematic review ( Gough and Thomas, 2016 ) of 23 studies published between 2020 and December 2022. The main aim was to gain an understanding of the way in which certain   dimensions   of   Tinto’s   theories   (student   personal   and psychological   characteristics;   pedagogical   and   counseling;   and social and relational) are approached in current research and to  Frontiers in   Education   07   frontiersin.org
