87  Spatial-temporal Analysis using Two-stage Clustering and GIS-based MCDM to Identify Potential Market Regions  Ernawati 1, *, Safiza Suhana Kamal Baharin 2   and Fauziah Kasmin 2  1 Universitas Atma Jaya Yogyakarta, Indonesia  2 Universiti Teknikal   Malaysia Melaka, Malaysia  ernawati@uajy.ac.id (corresponding author); safiza@utem.edu.my; fauziah@utem.edu.my  Abstract.   Promotion is essential in a competitive environment. Promotion to the right areas increases success and saves resources. However, due to Indonesia's vast territory and numerous regions of origin school, universities with student markets from all over the country must select target areas for promotion to meet their objectives and save resources. Unlike for-profit businesses, besides quantity factors, educational institutions need to consider student quality factors in selecting promotional locations. This study aims to conduct a data-driven spatio-temporal analysis to identify potential regions for university promotions targets. This study uses enrollment and academic data from one private university in Indonesia for the empirical study. In Geographic Information System (GIS) environment, the origin schools' locations were geocoded, and various thematic maps were analyzed. This study integrates two-stage clustering and GIS-based multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) to identify potential market regions. A potential region is one that consistently   sends   many   qualified   students.   First,   time-series   clustering   is conducted to groups regencies/cities based on the enrolled students' patterns over time in the university. Subsequently, the origin schools' regencies/cities were clustered using the k-prototypes algorithm based on their time-series pattern category, the consistency in sending students, average cumulative grade point average (CGPA), and dropout (DO) rate. The clusters are scored using the sum weighting method. The highest valued cluster that consists of eight regencies and 18 cities that consistently contributed high quantity and quality students were selected as the priority regions. The proposed approach's results were compared to the Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) methods for evaluation. The proposed method can assist the university management in determining potential regions for promotion purposes.  Keywords:   GIS, promotion, spatial temporal analysis, clustering, MCDM.

Data preprocessing and analysis were  carried out using R version 4.0.4. We used QGIS 3.18 and Geoda 1.1 8.0.0 for spatial  analysis and visualization in a GIS environment.  Fig. 1: The study area  3.3.   Methods  Figure 2 depicts the research framework. First, data for analysis are collected and  preprocessed. Data preprocessing involves integrating, selecting, and   cleaning data.  This study uses 11,861 data of students enrolled in 2014 to 2018 that cleaned down  to 11,199 records. This study aggregates students to their feeder school and includes  1,799 feeder schools from 338 regencies/cities for analysis. For spatial   analysis, the  feeder school locations are geocoded and overlaid on the regency/city shapefile. The  Global Moran's I spatial autocorrelation test is conducted to see the spatial pattern of  the school distribution. Various thematic maps are depicted and ana lyzed. Meanwhile,  to determine potential areas, two - stage clustering and MCDM methods are performed.  Finally, for assessing the outcome, the proposed method's results are compared to the  results of two commonly used MCDM methods, SAW   (Hwang & Yoon, 1981;  Sembiring et al., 2019)   and TOPSIS   (Hwang & Yoon, 1981) .

Time - series clustering is performed first to identify relatively  homogeneous regions' groups with similar student enrollment patterns over time. The  enrolled   students' trends are identified and analyzed. The time - series clustering is  carried out using the AHC method and DTW similarity measure, whereas for  determining the number of clusters, this study employs the Elbow method and  Calinski Harabasz validity inde x. The cluster categories which state the same enrolled  students' pattern over time produced by time - series clustering become one of the  inputs for the second stage clustering. The second stage clustering employs the k -  prototype since the data are mixed - da ta type. This step groups regions based on time -  series cluster patterns, consistency in sending students, average CGPA, and average  DO rates. Before clustering, the average CGPA and DO rates were normalized using  Z - score normalization, and the consistency   was discretized into five categories:  inconsistent, less consistent, moderately consistent, consistent, and very consistent.  Then, profiling is done based on the clustering results to determine the characteristics  of each cluster. Subsequently, each featur e in the cluster center is ranked and scored  based on its importance to university promotion for identifying potential regions. The  maximum score is equal to the number of clusters, and the lowest score is 1. If the  ranks are equal, the score receives the   average value of the existing scores. A cluster's  score is the weighted sum of its criteria scores. In this case, all criteria are given equal  weight. The cluster with the highest score is chosen as the potential cluster. The  regencies/cities in the potent ial cluster are the potential regions for promotion targets.

Results and discussion  4.1.   Spatial analysis  For spatial analysis, the number of enrolled students is mapped at the   origin school  level. Figure 4 depicts the distribution of origin schools and their contribution to  enrollment in the 2014 - 2018 period. Each bubble represents an origin school, and its  size corresponds to the number of students enrolled. The map shows that   the origin  schools are spread throughout Indonesia but are denser around the university and  several other regions. It is supported by the Global Moran's I test result, which can be  seen in the right up corner of Figure 4. Based on Moran's index I = 0.5062,   z - value =  9.1697, and pseudo - p - value = 0.001 (less than 0.05), the null hypothesis that origin  schools are randomly distributed is rejected, concluding that origin schools are  clustered. Hence, knowing where the origin schools are clustered is essential.  The origin   schools   are in 338 (66%) of Indonesia's 514 regencies/cities, spanning  all provinces. Two hundred forty - eight regions (73%) are regencies administrative  areas, while 90 regions (27%) are city administrative areas. Table 1 shows the  distribution   of the original schools' regencies/cities in each province. The table  compares the number of regencies and cities where the origin school is located to the  total number of regencies/cities in the province. For example, in Aceh Province,

Ernawati et al.   / Journal of System and Management Sc iences Vol.   11   (20 21 ) No. 4, pp.   8 7 - 11 2  98  schools of origin a re found in one of the 18 regencies and four of the five cities.  According to the data, the origin schools came from almost all existing cities (92%),  except for a few provinces on the Sumatra Island and the Maluku Archipelago. On  the other hand, the origi n schools are only located in 59% of all existing regencies.  Therefore, it is critical to pay attention to which regions the promotions will take  place, implying that management needs to devise different marketing strategies to  reach out to different regio ns.  Fig. 4: The feeder schools distribution and the Moran’s I test result  Among 1,799 origin schools, 922 (51%) were in regencies and 877 (49%) in cities.  Figure 5 depicts a thematic map of the number of school origins in each regency/city.  On average,   each region had about five schools of origin, three to four origin schools  in each regency, and nine to ten origin schools in each city. According to school type,  84% were senior high schools, 14% were vocational high schools, and 2% were  others like Madra sa, Islamic boarding school, homeschooling. According to the  school owner, 59% were public, while 41% were privately owned. Most of the public  schools (59%) were in the regencies. In contrast to the private schools, most were in  cities (60%). City schools   had an average DO rate of 3.74%, while the regency  schools had 4.08%. The average CGPA of origin schools was 2.97 (on the scale of  4), greater than in the regencies (2.90). Schools in cities were also more consistent in  sending students, on average, four t imes in five years, while schools in regencies were  three times in five years.

Each region  sent an average of 33 students, with a minimum of 1   and a maximum of 2,113 students.  The city of Yogyakarta, in the province where the university is located, supplied the  most students. The thematic map can show areas with no enrollment (white color  region) and other low - to - high student enrollment regions,   which is useful for  developing promotion planning. Most of the students came from schools located in  cities (61%). Students from senior high schools accounted for 94% of the total, and  most of them (64%) are graduated from private schools. Seventy percent   of students  came from city private schools, while for the regency, 55% came from public schools.  The ratio of male to female students was 53:47, with city schools accounting for 58%  of male students. Simultaneously, 64% of female students attended city sc hools.  Fig. 6: The distribution of students enrolled in 2014 - 2018  4.2.   Temporal analysis  After it is proven that the origin schools are clustered, two - stage clustering is used to  determine the characteristics of the schools and determine potential market reg ions  for promotion targets. This subsection explains the result of time - series clustering as

According to the Elbow method, as shown in Figure 9,  we chose seven clusters rather than ten as the optimum number of clusters because it  is easier to interpret for a small number of clusters   (Ernawati et al., 2021)   and does  not produce clusters with a too - small number of members.

They have  high - quality students with an average CGPA of 2.91 and a DO rate of 4.16%.

Introduction  Recognizing a potential market is critical to the success of businesses. Adopting  information technology into companies' business operations enables them to explore  potential markets using data - driven analysis. Unified information is a crucial  component th at can be used to put optimal decision - making knowledge into practice  (Mekvabidze, 2020) . As the market becomes more competitive, businesses seek more  valuable insights into their customers, and data m ining tools can assist in better  understanding their customers   (Dahiya et al., 2021) . By empowering data mining  techniques, businesses can   extract hidden knowledge from their customers' data and  use it to develop more efficient marketing strategies and personalize promotional  offers   (Roshan & A fsharinezhad, 2017) . Likewise, in Higher Education Institutions  (HEIs), with large volumes of student data such as registration and academic data,  HEIs can utilize data mining to explore students' historical data to find targeted  customers   (Abaya & Gerardo, 2013) .  High schools are students' source for universities because most prospective  students are senior high school fresh graduates. The number of senior high schools  and vocational high schools in Indonesia,   the world's fourth most populous country,  reaches 28,240   (Badan Pusat Statistik, 2020) . They represent a potential market for  universities, particularly for most universities in Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta  Province, a special region where many out - of - town s tudents study. The schools are  spread over a very wide area (1,196,862.20 km² ) in 514 regencies/cities   (BPS -  Statistics Indonesia, 2019) , so school - to - school promotion and recruitment require  huge   resources.   However,   student   popul ations   tend   to   congregate   in   specific  geographic locations   (Tang & Mcdonald, 2002) , so selecting target areas for  promotion and recruitment needs to be done to achieve university goals and save  resources.  Previous studies identified target school districts using a model based on spatial  analysis.   Ayad (2007)   recommended potential school districts for recruitment using  the gravity index. The   model   considers parameters such as SAT takers in a sp ecific  year, median household income, and driving distance to the university.   Martin (2001)  developed a model to measure the school district's poten tial to increase the university  enrollment of minority populations. It depends on the district's number of university -  bound students and is inversely proportional to the distance between the university  and the school district. The target school district is   determined based on the potential  of the school district, the ethnic composition of university - bound students, and the  "quality" of the district as measured by SAT score. These models used single - year  data. On the other hand, enrollment is a trend   (Morris & Thrall, 2010) , so detecting  changes in school enrolment patter ns should be done by including university - bound  features for school districts over a longer period   (Martin, 2001) . Therefore, in  addition to spatial analysis, the temporal dimension o f spatial data should be  examined; as suggested by   Kelly (2019) , geospatial education researchers should pay

Page 3:
Ernawati et al.   / Journal of System and Management Sc iences Vol.   11   (20 21 ) No. 4, pp.   8 7 - 11 2  89  more attention to the temporal dimensions of spatial data.  The purpose of this research is to identify potential regions for university  promotion and recruitment targets. The spatial and temp oral analysis is conducted  using historical data from one university in Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta Province to  discover prospective areas that meet both quality and quantity objectives. The  cumulative grade point average (CGPA) and students' dropout (DO) r ate at the end  of the fourth semester of the university studies are used to assess the quality.   Besides  the fact that many students drop out during their first and second years of study  (Ousley, 2010) , this data also   assesses students' readiness to study at a university  during their early years of study. The quantity aspect is represented by time - series  data on enrolled students and the region's consistency in sending students to the  university. The motivation of this   study is to utilize internal institutional data to  support higher education institution management in developing marketing strategies.  Location is critical in marketing   (Libó rio et al. , 2020) . Many location analyses have  been used to   reveal   particular spatial patterns or identify suitable locations for  resource management, service provision, and business decisions   (Tong & Murray,  2017) . Moreover, researchers a lso can utilize big data to review location theories,  develop location applications and frameworks, and integrate Geographic Information  System (GIS) more deeply into location analysis   (Tong & Murray, 2017) . GIS is a  useful and effe ctive tool for assisting decision - making in spatial analysis   (Chacó n -  garcí a, 2017; Oliveira et al., 2020) . GIS could provide a more comprehensive and  holistic approach, where decisions are supported by visual solutions   (Jurisic et al.,  2016) . In the education domain, GIS is applied to analyze educational facilities  distribution   (Lagrab & Aknin, 2015; Murad et al., 2020) , accessibility of education  service   (Bulti et al., 2018) , provision of educational services ( Constantinidis, 2019) ,  which is beneficial for facility management and site planning.  The spatio - temporal analysis involves temporal aspects of spatial data. The spatio -  temporal analysis is a technique for identifying and visualizing trends in   spatial  patterns over time   (Rosyidah & Surjandari, 2019) . Spatio - temporal analysis has been  applied in business practices for supporting decision - making processes in marketing  and customer relationship development, investment, resource , and asset management  (Surjandari & Rosyidah, 2017) . In the education domain, spatio - temporal analysis  has been used to investigate the spatial distribution of schools over time   (Ghodousi,  et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) .  Because many factors influence location decisions, some studies combined GIS  and multi - criteria decision - making (MCDM) to solve the site selection problem.  Herlawati et al. (2020)   proposed G IS - based MCDM to analyze the suitable district  for central business. The weighted sum method was applied to six criteria of the  overlaid layers. The weighted sum is popular in the GIS - MCDM approach because it  is straightforward to implement in the GIS envi ronment utilizing algebra operations  and simple to grasp   (Malczewski, 2006) . Another popular MCDM technique that has

Page 4:
Ernawati et al.   / Journal of System and Management Sc iences Vol.   11   (20 21 ) No. 4, pp.   8 7 - 11 2  90  been applied with GIS is Analytic Hierarchy   Process (AHP)   (Chacó n - garcí a, 2017;  Saha et al., 2020; Yıldırım, 2021) . GIS - based MCDM is also employed in the  education   domain to identify the most proper school location and area   (Baser, 2020;  Lagrab & Aknin, 2017; Prasetyo et al., 2018) . GIS - based MCDM has demonstrated  promising   results   because   it   considers   geographic al   data   in   decision - making  (Herlawati et al., 2020; Saha et al., 2020) .  Besides many criteria in decision making, location selection frequently includes  many alternatives, so data mining techniques are involved to group data. Clustering  is one of these   tec hniques   used to group similar data into the same cluster while  placing different data in different clusters.   Aryaee   (2019)   used GIS, clustering, and  MCDM to choose the locations of bank branches. The best worst method was used  to determine the weight of criteria and sub - criteria. After importing the criteria, sub -  criteria, and weights into GIS layers and analyzing th em on a district map grid, the  34 areas with the highest priority were chosen as candidate points. The Fuzzy C -  means method was used to cluster the candidate points, and then the most important  cluster was determined using the Technique for Order of Prefer ence by Similarity to  Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method. The Complex Proportional Assessment (COPRAS)  method prioritizes the points in the most important cluster, and the proper locations  are determined. However, this study has not yet included the temporal a spect.  This research uses GIS - based spatio - temporal analysis, two - stage clustering, and  the MCDM method. The origin schools' spatial distribution is examined using Global  Moran's I test. Time - series clustering identifies the temporal pattern of the school  region based on its enrolled students, while the mixed - data type clustering is  employed to cluster schools' regions based on the regions' temporal pattern, average  CGPA, DO rate, and consistency in sending students. The sum weighting method is  applied to d etermine the potential cluster as a promotion target. The potential regions  identified by the proposed approach are compared to the Simple Additive Weighting  (SAW)   (Hwang & Yoon, 1981; Sembiring et al., 2019) , and TOPSIS   (Hwang & Yoon,  1981)   results for evaluation. The contributions of this paper are summarized as  follows. This study proposes a novel approach integrating two - stage clustering: time -  series clustering and mixed - data type   clustering with GIS - based MCDM to support  higher education institutions' decision - making. This study considers not only spatial  but also temporal aspects. The empirical findings of this research show that the  combination of spatial and temporal analysis, t wo - stage clustering, and GIS - based  MCDM successfully identified potential regions and may be recommended for  university promotion targets.  2.   Theoretical background  2.1.   Global Moran’s I  Global Moran's I statistics, first proposed by Moran in 1948 (Anselin , 2020), is a  commonly used method to investigate global spatial autocorrelation. It is useful to

The AHC algorithm is used to group regions  based on five - year time - series data of enrolled students. Based on the Elbo w method  and the Calinski Harabasz (CH) index, the optimum number of clusters (k) is five.  The Elbow method graphic in Figure 7 shows that there is an elbow at k=5. Before  k=5, there is a significant decrease in the SSE, but as k increases after k=5, the   SSE  does not decrease significantly. Likewise, the Calinski Harabasz graphic in Figure 7  shows that the maximum value of the CH index occurs at k=5.  The 338 regions were then clustered into five groups based on similar temporal  patterns of enrolled   university   students. The time - series patterns of students enrolled  in the 2014 - 2018 school year are presented in Figure 8. According to Figure 8, the  profil es of the five clusters are described as follow:  •   The first time - series cluster (TSC1) comprises 71 cities and 239 regencies that  sent a very small number of students with minor fluctuations. Each region sent  two students per year on average.  •   TSC2 contains   five cities and three regencies, sent a moderately large number of  students, an average of 44 students per year, which had somehow increasing trend.  Fig.   7: Elbow method and Calinski Harabasz index for determining the number of  clusters  •   TSC3 incl udes 12 cities and six regencies, sent roughly 22 students annually with  a horizontal trend and minor fluctuation.  •   TSC4 contains one city and one regency, sent an average of 97 students per year.  These regions experienced quite high fluctuations in the num ber of enrolled  students. One of them is the regency where the university is located, whereas  another is the city in the nearest province to the university.  •   TSC5   includes   the   closest   city   to   the   university,   sent   the   most   students,  approximately 422 student s per year. The number of students fluctuated, with a  downward trend in the last year.  0.00  100.00  200.00  300.00  400.00  2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  number of clusters  Elbow method   Calinski Harabasz

In terms of sending students, this cluster contains  regions that are inconsistent to very consistent, but the majority are inconsistent.  Despite the low DO rate (2.22%), academic performance is poor (an average  CGPA of 2.12). This cluster contains 4.22%   origin schools, which sent 1.95% of  students.  •   Cluster3 has 6% regions (2 cities and 19 regencies), all of which have a TSC1  pattern. The majority are areas that consistently send students, but have the lowest  quality (DO rate 33.21% and CGPA 2.20). This c luster sent the fewest students  (0.82%) from 2.83% origin schools.  •   Cluster4 includes 8% regions (18 cities and eight regencies) with TSC2, TSC3,  TSC4, and TSC5 patterns and is very consistent in sending students, so supplied  the most students (57.04%). Thi s cluster have 26.57% origin schools with very  good quality students (CGPA 2.98 and DO rate 3.44%).  •   Cluster5 comprises 13% of the regions (eight cities and 37 regencies), with all  regions following a TSC1 pattern and the majority of them being less   consistent  in sending students. It has a very low DO rate (0.37%) and a CGPA of 2.93 on  average. These regions contain 5.39% origin schools and 1.69% students.  •   Cluster6 comprises 10% regions (7 cities and 26 regencies), all of which have a  TSC1 pattern and   are moderately consistent in sending students. It has an average  DO rate of 2.46% and an average CGPA of 2.97. This cluster contains 4.50%  origin schools which sent 1.43% of students.  •   Cluster7 has 16% of the regions (7 cities and 47 regencies) that sent t he best  students (no dropout and CGPA 3.16). It has a TSC1 pattern, and most of them  are inconsistent in sending students, so supplied only 0.96% of students. There are  4.00% of origin schools in these areas.  4.4.   Multi - criteria potential area determination  As   this study employs a weighting sum of the variable scores for deciding the best  potential cluster, each cluster center criterion from the seven clusters is ordered based  on its value in decision making and given a score with a maximum score of 7 and a  mini mum of 1. The cluster with the highest CGPA received a score of 7, while the  lowest received a score of 1, whereas the DO rate was the inverse. The cluster that is  more consistent in sending students is given a higher score.

According to co - location analysis, the three methods recommended  ten identical regions. As seen in Figure 13, the proposed approach has 11 identical  regions to the SAW and 15 to the TOPSIS. The recommended r egions by the three  methods are very consistent in sending students. The ten co - locations regions have  an average DO rate of 2.81%,   CGPA of 3.08, contain all temporal patterns except  TSC1 with a very high number of students sent (462 students on average).   Five  overlap regions between the proposed method and TOPSIS and one overlap region  between the proposed method and SAW have a TSC3 temporal pattern, so the average  of students sent higher than the five overlap regions between the SAW and TOPSIS  but lost i n terms of the students quality (DO rates higher and CGPA lower). For  regions that are only recommended by each method, SAW recommends the highest  quality students regions but has a TSC1 temporal pattern with few students sent.  TOPSIS suggests regions with   a higher DO rate than SAW but nearly the same CGPA  as the proposed method. The TOPSIS recommends regions with TSC1 and TSC2  temporal patterns with moderately enrolled students, whereas the proposed method  recommends regions with higher DO rates with TSC3   temporal patterns that sent the  highest number of enrolled students.  Fig.   13: Overlaps of the potential regions using the proposed method, SAW, and  TOPSIS.  Table 3 summarizes all the regions' characteristics suggested by each method. T he  SAW method sug gests   areas   with a lower DO rate and a higher average CGPA but  significantly smaller enrolled students. Even though the average DO rate is slightly  higher and the average CGPA is slightly lower, the proposed method can identify  locations that supply more e nrolled students. The TOPSIS method yields results that  fall somewhere between SAW and the proposed method. Based on the analysis, it  appears that the proposed method suggests regions with larger enrolled students than  the other two methods, despite having   a slightly higher DO rate and lower CGPA  because areas with no student dropouts and high CGPA but low enrolled students are  grouped in a separate cluster (Cluster7).

Conclusion  This study applies spatio - temporal analysis, two - stage clustering, and the MCDM  method to   identify potential regions for university promotion targets.   The origin  schools' regency/city spatial unit is analyzed in the GIS environment using enrollment  and academic data from one Indonesian private university. The temporal analysis is  conducted us ing time - series clustering to reveal the enrollment trends, and then for  determining the potential regions, mixed data type clustering and MCDM are used.  According to Global Moran's I test, the university students' origin schools are  clustered. The origin   schools are located in more regencies than cities, but most  students come from schools located in cities. Students from city schools are relatively  better in quality. Furthermore, schools in the city are more consistent in sending larger  numbers of student s. Five distinct patterns emerged from the temporal analysis.  Horizontal trends and minor fluctuations were discovered in two clusters of regions  with the fewest students enrolled. The trend tends to rise slightly in the cluster with  moderately enrolled st udents, while it fluctuates with a trend to fall in the last analysis  year for two clusters' areas with the highest student enrollments.  Potential areas for promotion targets were successfully determined using the k -  prototype algorithm and the weighted su m of the clusters' variables score, based on  the time - series pattern   category , the consistency in sending students, average CGPA,  and DO rate. Eight districts and 18 cities in Cluster4 are designated as target regions.  The   proposed   approach's   findings   can   help   university   management   develop  promotional plans and allocate resources for promotional activities. Compared to the  SAW and TOPSIS methods, these 26 regencies/cities supply the most students.  According to the analysis, by applying time - series clusterin g first to the number of  enrolled students data, the proposed method generates regions with more enrolled  students than the other two methods, although with slightly lower quality because  areas with no dropouts and very high CGPA but relatively low enrolle d students are  grouped in a separate cluster (Cluster7). Thus decision - makers can select regions in  Cluster7 and apply different marketing strategies. The proposed approach has not yet  been applied to the target schools level, can be considered for future   work.

Moran's I inference is  based on the null hypothesis of spatial randomness on data. In Geoda softwar e  (Anselin, 2020), there are six outputs of Global Moran's test, namely the Moran's  index (I), the expected values (E(I)), the mean, the standard deviation, the z - score,  and the pseudo - p - value. If I > E(I) or the z - score is high with a p - value less than th e  significance value, the null hypothesis is rejected, indicating that the data is clustered.  The Moran's I index is calculated using Equation (1)   (Ghodousi et al., 2020) :  𝐼   =   𝑛   ∑   ∑   𝑤 𝑖𝑗 𝑧 𝑖 𝑧 𝑗  𝑛  𝑗 = 1  𝑛  𝑖 = 1  𝑆 0   ∑   𝑧 𝑖  2 𝑛  𝑖 = 1  (1)  where n denotes the number of observations, z i   denotes the deviation of each  observation   from   the   mean, w ij   denotes the spatial weight between observations i and  j, and S 0   is the sum of all spatial weights.  2.2.   Time - series clustering  Clustering is the process of partitioning observations into clusters of similar objects  without having prior knowledge of   the clusters. Objects in the same cluster are like  one another, but not to objects in other   clusters . The process of grouping time - series  data based on their similarity is known as time - series clustering   (Guijo - Rubio et al.,  2020) . Time - series clustering is classified into three types: whole time - series  clustering, subseq uence clustering, and time - points clustering   (Aghabozorgi et al.,  2015) . A set of individual time - series data is clustered based on their similarity in  whole time - series clustering. Subsequence clustering objects are obtained by dividing  a single long time - series data based on similarity. In time - points clustering, the  clustering objects are single points from a single time - series. In this study, the whole  time - series clustering is performed to identify the regions' pattern shapes based on  the number of enrolled students in the university.  For matches time - series based on shapes,   two time - series data are aligned by a  non - linear stretching and contracting of the time axes. This method mainly uses  traditional clustering methods and works wit h the raw time - series data directly.  Shape - based methods are proper for short time - series data   (Aghabozorgi et al., 2015) .  The most popular shape - based similarity measures are the Euclidean distance and  Dynamic Time Warping distance (DTW)   (Aghabozorgi et al., 2015; Guijo - Rubio et  al., 2020) .   Although Euclidean distance is the most efficient   (Guijo - Rubio et al. ,  2020) , the DTW method is the most accurate   (Aghabozorgi et al., 2015; Javed et al.,  2020) , so DTW is used in this study along with Agglomerative Hierarchical  Clustering (AHC) for time - series clustering   (Abbasimehr & Shabani, 2020) .  A hierarchical clustering method groups objects in a dataset into a dendrogram, a  hierarchy of cluster structures   (Han et al., 2012) . It is classified as either an  agglomerative or a divisive ap proach. AHC starts with each object in a separate  cluster, then gradually merges the clusters based on similarity until all objects are  grouped into a single cluster. The basic AHC algorithm is comprised of the following  steps   (Bramer, 2016) :

Since the enrolled student  pattern category for Clusters 2,3,4,6,7 is the same, their score is the average value of  their rank (5,4,3,2 and 1), which equals 3. The cluster score is a weighted sum of its  variable s cores, and we assigned the same weight to each criterion (0.25). For  example,   Cluster1’s   score   is   (3*0.25+2*0.25+6*0.25+6*0.25)=4.25.   Table   2  displays the results of the given scoring and the ranking of each cluster.  According to Table 2, Cluster4 has the   highest ranking, thus chosen as the target  market. This cluster consists of 26 regions (18 cities and eight regencies) set as  potential regions for   promotion , as displayed in Figure 12. Even though it only  contains 8% of the regions, these areas contribute   57.04% of students. These regions  also sent high - quality students. The highly potential regions are spread across 15  provinces in five main islands (Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Java, Papua) and two  archipelagos (Riau and Nusa Tenggara Archipelago). Mos t of them are on the Island  of Java, in cities/regencies close to the university.

For each object, make a single - object cluster and determine the distance between  each pair of clusters.  2. Select the two closest   clusters and merge them into a single cluster.  3. Calculate the distance between each of the old and new clusters.  4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all objects are grouped in a single cluster.  The DTW's goal   is   to discover correspondences between two   time - series sequences.  In the case of two time - series, A = (a 1 , a 2 , ..., a n ) and B = (b 1 , b 2 , ..., b m ), the DTW  algorithm would first create an n x m matrix to minimize discrepancies between A  and B. Calculate the element of the matrix (M ij ) starting from the   left bottom corner  using equation (2):  𝑀 𝑖𝑗   =   | 𝑎 𝑖   −   𝑏 𝑗 |   +   min   ( 𝑀 ( 𝑖 − 1 ) ( 𝑗 − 1 ) ,   𝑀 𝑖 ( 𝑗 − 1 ) , 𝑀 ( 𝑖 − 1 ) 𝑗 )   (2)  Subsequently,   starting   from the top right corner element of the matrix, find its  neighbor with the minimum value as the traversal path until it reaches the   bottom left  to find the warping path P = (p 1 , p 2 , ..., p K ). Finally, the DTW distance between A and  B can be calculated by Equation (3)   (Sammour et al., 2019) :  𝑑 𝐴𝐵   =   𝑚𝑖𝑛   ∑   𝑝 𝑘  𝐾  𝑘 = 1  𝐾   (3)  2.3.   K - prototypes mixed - da ta types clustering  Besides hierarchical clustering, another type of clustering algorithm is partitioning  clustering. K - means is the most used partitioning algorithm. However, because this  algorithm is only suitable for numerical data, several developments , such as k - modes  used to group categorical data and k - prototypes used to group mixed data, have been  made to overcome its shortcomings   (H uang, 1998) .   Sulastri et al. (2021)   clustered  schools using k - prototypes based on student admission   data. This current study uses  the k - prototypes algorithm to cluster origin schools’ regions based on numerical data  (average CGPA and DO rate) and categorical data (origin schools' regions temporal  pattern and consistency in sending students). The k - proto types algorithm divides a  dataset with n objects, p numerical attributes, and m - p categorical data into k different  clusters by minimizing the cost function value in equation (4)   ( Huang, 1998; Jia &  Song, 2020) :  𝐹 ( 𝑊 ,   𝑄 )   =   ∑   ∑   𝑤 𝑖𝑙 𝑑 ( 𝑥 𝑖  𝑛  𝑖 = 1  𝑘  𝑙 = 1   ,   𝑞 𝑙 )   (4)  subject to equation (5):  ∑   𝑤 𝑖𝑙   =   1 , 𝑘  𝑙 = 1   𝑤 𝑖𝑙   ∈   { 0 , 1 } ,   1   ≤   𝑖   ≤   𝑛 ,   1   ≤   𝑙   ≤   𝑘   (5)  where W is an n× k partition matrix,   Q = {q 1 , q 2 , ..., q k } is the cluster center set, q l  is the l - th cluster's center, and d(x i ,q l ) is the dissimilarity measure between data object  and cluster center.   Huang (1998)   integrated Euclidean distances (used in k - means) to  calculate numerical data dissimilarity and the simple m atching method (used in k -  modes)   for   categorical   data   dissimilarity   in   the   k - prototypes   algorithm.

The dissimilarity  measure of X and Y using the simple matching method is defined in equation (7)  (Huang, 1998) :  𝛿 ( 𝑥 𝑖 ,   𝑦 𝑖 )   =   { 𝑜   𝑖𝑓   𝑥 𝑖   =   𝑦 𝑖  1   𝑖𝑓   𝑥 𝑖   ≠   𝑦 𝑖  (7)  The basic steps of the k - prototypes algorithm are as follow   (Jia & Song, 2020) :  1.   Select k data objects randomly from   the dataset as the initial cluster centers.  2.   Compute the dissimilarity between object x i   and the cluster center q l   using  equation (6), then assign x i   to the nearest prototype cluster. Apply this step to all  x i   objects in the dataset and the k cluster center s.  3.   Determine the new cluster centers. Use the average value for numerical attributes  and the highest frequency (mode) for categorical attributes as the center.  4.   Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the cost function in equation (4) is no longer changes.  Like the k - me ans algorithm, the number of clusters must be specified before using  the k - prototypes algorithm, so this study employs k - prototypes and the well - known  Elbow method. The Elbow method uses a sum of squared errors (SSE), which is the  variation of each cluster   member concerning its centroid.  2.4.   Multi - criteria decision - making (MCDM)  MCDM   is   a   problem - solving   methodology   that   includes   many   criteria   and  alternatives that must be considered when deciding. MCDM methods such as SAW,  TOPSIS,   AHP,   Preference   Ranking   Organ ization   Method   for   Enrichment  Evaluations (PROMETHEE), and COPRAS are widely used by decision - makers.  Aside from CORPAS, SAW and TOPSIS are regarded as the most efficient and user -  friendly MCDM methods   (Sotoudeh - Anvari et al., 2018) .  The basic   idea   behind SAW is to assess the wei ghted sum of each alternative's  criteria score   (Sembiring et al., 2019) . For example, if the pro blem has m criteria (C 1 ,  C 2 , ..., C m ) with corresponding weights (w 1 , w 2 , ...,w m ) and n alternatives (A 1 , A 2 , ...,  A n ), the SAW solution steps are as follows. First, create a decision matrix (X nxm ) and  normalize it to get a normalized decision matrix (R nxm )   using equation (8):  𝑟 𝑖𝑗   =   {  𝑥 𝑖𝑗  max   ( 𝑥 𝑖𝑗 )   ;   𝑖𝑓   𝐶 𝑗   𝑖𝑠   𝑎   𝑏𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑓𝑖𝑡   𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑛  min   ( 𝑥 𝑖𝑗 )  𝑥 𝑖𝑗  ;   𝑖𝑓   𝐶 𝑗   𝑖𝑠   𝑎   𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡   𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑛  (8)  Then, for each   alternative , compute the weighted sum   𝑆 𝑖   =   ∑   𝑤 𝑖 𝑟 𝑖𝑗  𝑛  𝑖 = 1   . The better  the alternative, the higher the S i   value.

Ernawati et al.   / Journal of System and Management Sc iences Vol.   11   (20 21 ) No. 4, pp.   8 7 - 11 2  94  The   fundamental   idea behind TOPSIS   (Hwang & Yoon, 1981)   is that the best  alternative should be the one that is closest t o the best solution and farthest apart from  the worst   (Zemlickienė, 2019) . The TOPSIS method, like the SAW method, solves  the problem through the normalization steps o f the decision matrix using equation (9):  𝑟 𝑖𝑗   =   𝑥 𝑖𝑗  √ ∑   𝑥 𝑖𝑗  2 𝑛  𝑖 = 1  (9)  The weighted   normalized   decision matrix   𝑠 𝑖𝑗   =   𝑤 𝑖 𝑟 𝑖𝑗   is then computed. Using  equations (10) and (11), calculate the positive ideal solution   𝐴 +   =   ( 𝑠 1  + ,   𝑠 2  + ,   ...   ,   𝑠 𝑚  +   )  and the negative ideal solution   =   ( 𝑠 1  − ,   𝑠 2  − ,   ...   ,   𝑠 𝑚  −   ) .  𝑠 𝑗  +   =   { max ( 𝑠 𝑖𝑗 )   ;   𝑖𝑓   𝐶 𝑗   𝑖𝑠   𝑎   𝑏𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑓𝑖𝑡   𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑛  min ( 𝑠 𝑖𝑗 ) ;   𝑖𝑓   𝐶 𝑗   𝑖𝑠   𝑎   𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡   𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑛   (10)  𝑠 𝑗  −   =   { min ( 𝑠 𝑖𝑗 )   ;   𝑖𝑓   𝐶 𝑗   𝑖𝑠   𝑎   𝑏𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑓𝑖𝑡   𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑛  max ( 𝑠 𝑖𝑗 ) ;   𝑖𝑓   𝐶 𝑗   𝑖𝑠   𝑎   𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡   𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑛   (11)  The next step is to   determine   the distances of each alternative from the positive  ideal solution ( 𝑑 𝑖  + )   and the negative ideal solution ( 𝑑 𝑖  − )   using equations (12) and (13):  𝑑 𝑖  +   =   √ ∑   ( 𝑠 𝑖𝑗   −   𝑠 𝑗  + ) 2 𝑚  𝑗 = 1   (12)  𝑑 𝑖  −   =   √ ∑   ( 𝑠 𝑖𝑗   −   𝑠 𝑗  − ) 2 𝑚  𝑗 = 1   (13)  Finally, compute the relative closeness of each alternative to the   ideal solution (D i )  using equation (14). The higher the Di score, the better the alternative.  𝐷 𝑖   =   𝑑 𝑖  −  𝑑 𝑖  − + 𝑑 𝑖  +   (14)  3.   Study area, materials, and methods  3.1.
