In   Figure 2   we present the  most relevant factors from the literature ( Berlanga et al., 2018 ;   Barroso  et al., 2022 ), grouped into dimensions: (a) Biographical and socio-  demographic attributes; (b) Self-perceptions prior to entry; (c) Goals  and commitment; (d) Experiences in the institution; (e) and academic  and social integration.  Regardless of the explanatory models of dropout, there are several  strategies that universities carry out to overcome dropout, but there  are no general protocols to prevent it ( Lizarte Simón and Gijón Puerta,  2022 ).   Based   on   the   latest   reports   from   various   Andalusian  universities, the creation of Guidance Units at the faculties is presented  as one of the aid plans that best works avoid cases of abandonment.  Orientation is part of the educational process and has become an  indicator of the quality and functioning of university systems ( Vidal  et al., 2002 ).  As an example, we present the Guidance Unit of the Faculty of  Educational Sciences of the University of Granada ( Villena et al.,  2013 ), whose most relevant tasks can be grouped into three categories:  (a) Care program to the Baccalaureates (reception and attention of  Baccalaureate students in the faculty, organizing open days, attention  to counselors of Secondary Education Schools, or participation in  FIGURE 2  Factors related to early dropout and their dimensions.

Overall results  Firstly, the word count consultation carried out has allowed us to  establish a “library” of abandonment from the perspective of the  research participants. The library, which includes the concepts most  used by the students who dropped out and participated in the  research, is summarized in   Figure 5 , highlighting the concepts with  the greatest relative weight in   Figure 6 . These concepts are, in order of  frequency: University; Studies; Positive; Teachers; Positive; Teachers;  Work; Memories; University Degree; Subjects; dropout and graduation  (together with the associated word family).  The cloud of concepts generated from the frequency query also  shows that the core of concepts that students handle around the  process of dropping out, which is not considered negative (“good”)  and which is concentrated around the university and the studies taken  (“university,” “studies,” and “career”), is complemented by reference to  the completion of studies and dropping out (“degree” and “dropout”)  and to “memories” of “class,” “teachers” and “subjects” (“good”) and  “memories” of “class,” “teachers” and “subjects” (“good”) (see   Figure 7 ).  Finally, the self-coding on feelings gives us a general idea of how  the students have experienced the dropout process and whether  positive or negative aspects dominate in their memories. In our case,  out of 486 codes extracted by the program, 22 are indicated as “very  negative” and 66 as “very positive,” with those labeled as “moderately  negative” –168– and those labeled as “moderately positive” -230-  being much more represented. Thus, NVivo ®   presents the participants’  experiences and feelings about the abandonment process as “neutral”  – neither positive nor negative – both at the global level and in each  of the cases analyzed (see   Figure 8 ).  3.2. A model of knowledge about dropout  From the narrative review of the CAB and CON dimensions of  the interview, it has been possible to construct a conceptual map on  the most relevant factors for dropout and the advice offered by  participants to prospective students and universities ( Figure 9 ).  Although there are factors (causes) associated with dropout that  are circumstantial, such as a «pandemia mundial que al año siguiente  tendría que pagar la misma matrícula y con la incertidumbre de hacer  curso online o hacer curso presencial» (JA03) (global pandemic that  the following year I would have to pay the same tuition and with the  uncertainty of taking an online course or taking a classroom course),  those that appear are organized around: (a) the teaching staff; (b) the  subjects and the career; (c) factors related to motivation; (d) factors  related to integration and commitment; (e) economic resources; (f)  and work or family problems.

Gijón et al.   10.3389/feduc.2023.1130194  Frontiers in   Education   06   frontiersin.org  As for the teaching staff, there is a certain lack of involvement and  renewal of contents and methods: «el profesor de informática que nos  explicaban cositas de matemáticas como si fuéramos retrasados»  (GR05) (the computer teacher who explained little things about  mathematics to us as if we were retarded).  The subjects, the syllabi, and the degrees themselves are the  subject of reflections that place them among the causes of dropout. On  the one hand, there is some talk about the difficulty of the courses.  JA01 indicates that «abandoné porque después de intentarlo mucho  me di cuenta de que no avanzaba en los estudios y cada vez eran más  difíciles» (I dropped out because after trying a lot I realized that I was  not progressing in my studies and they were getting harder and  harder). Also the repetition of content (GR01 states that «estaba un  poco desilusionada. Rollo, el temario era muy repetitivo para el primer  año, vale. El segundo, vuelves y haces otra vez lo mismo y cuando  empiezas el tercero y ves que hacen lo mismo, es como que echas aquí  cuatro años para aprender absolutamente nada» (I was a little  disappointed. The syllabus was very repetitive for the first year. The  second, you come back and do the same thing again and when  you start the third and see that they do the same thing, it’s like  you spend 4   years here to learn absolutely nothing”) and its eminently  theoretical character is highlighted by some students, such as JA02,  who states that «lo que me motivó realmente fueron el poco interés  que había en ese grado a la actividad práctica y el tanto que había el  marco teórico había acercamiento a la historia desde un punto de vista  práctico. Simplemente era absorción de conocimiento y luego  plasmarlos en un examen» (what really motivated me was the little  interest there was in that grade to practical activity and the fact that  there was so much theoretical framework there was an approach to  FIGURE 6  Representation of the concepts with the highest relative importance that make up the abandonment library.

Another   remarkable   aspect   is   the   lack   of   resources   as   a  determinant factor or cause of dropout, indicated by the participants,  which is the lack of financial resources or the need to work to get  them. JA08 states that «no podía persistir porque no aprobé todas y  no tenía dinero para la matrícula. Me gustaba la carrera, pero no  conseguí sacar las asignaturas» (I could not persist because I did not  pass all of them and I did not have the money for tuition fees. I liked  the course, but I did not manage to pass the subjects). JA10 also  stresses the problem of resources, when he indicates that «mis motivos  fueron escasa ayuda económica» (my reasons were lack of financial  support). JA11 says that «verdaderamente, el principal motivo, como  he dicho, fue el económico. El hecho de que ganase buen dinero y que  hiciera falta fue lo principal para para no seguir» (the true main  reason, as I said, was financial. The fact that I earned good money and  that I needed it was the main reason for not continuing), the same as  JA13, who tells us that he left «los estudios para trabajar por falta de  recursos   económicos»   (his   studies   to   work   due   to   lack   of  economic resources).  Finally, it is family problems or incompatibility with work that  cause drop-out. Dropping out is caused by «el hecho de que entre el  trabajo diario y luego otras circunstancias de tareas, digamos  familiares que también tienes» (GR09) (the fact that between the daily  work and then other circumstances of duties, let us say family duties  that you also have), as time becomes the limiting factor: «por falta de  tiempo y no por falta de ganas. Te digo, si tuviera tiempo seguiría  estudiando» GR06 (due to lack of time and not due to lack of desire.  I tell you, if I had time I would continue studying).  The narrative reorganization of the CON dimension allows us to  build the hierarchical knowledge model (conceptual map agreed by  experts   –in   this   case   the   research   team–),   which   shows   the  relationships or connections between the concepts shown. In our case,  two categories or concepts generate a first level – the most inclusive –:  students and institutions.  The concept “students” focuses on study, breaking down into  “university” and “pre-university studies.” The concept “institutions”  unfolds into four less inclusive concepts: teachers; organization;  qualification; and guidance which, in turn, is opened to university  guidance, pre-university guidance and, with special emphasis,  vocational training.  4. Discussion  The extensive literature on dropout reveals that several factors  recur – with varying degrees of importance – in the different models  FIGURE 9  Knowledge model representing the factors associated with dropout and with advice from students who dropped out.

Lizarte  1 *  1  Department of Didactics and School Organization, University of Granada, Granada, Spain,   2  Laboratory  for Cognition, Health, Training and Interaction Among Humans, Animals and Machines, University of  Granada, Granada, Spain  The abandonment of university studies is a problem that affects the balance  and correct organization of university systems throughout the world and that  has undesirable personal consequences in advanced societies. Dropping out of  school has a multidimensional explanation. Among the causes, associated with  each other, that originate it, the following factors stand out: psychological, social,  economic, psycho-pedagogical, institutional, and didactic. Studying how all  these dimensions act and relate to each other in specific cases of people who  drop out of Higher Education, helps us to better understand the phenomenon  and to develop prevention measures in university institutions. This text presents  the results of biographical-narrative research carried out among the student  population in a situation of abandonment of the universities of Andalusia that  has allowed us to recover 22 stories of abandonment carried out by as many ex-  students who were enrolled in any of the nine universities. Andalusians publish  in any of the different university degree studies. The biographical texts have  been subjected to narrative analysis to achieve personal exemplifications and  characterize paradigmatic cases of relationship between the dimensions of the  problem, using concept mapping to present the outcomes.  KEYWORDS  dropout, higher education, concept mapping, narrative methodology, biographical  method  1. Introduction  There is great international concern about student retention in higher education institutions,  especially in recent years ( Foster and Francis, 2020 ;   Casanova et al., 2021 ), being also a concern  for Spain and its universities ( Lizarte, 2017a ,   2020 ;   Lizarte and Fernández, 2020 ). Dropout  undoubtedly occurs as an interconnected result of social, family, economic and personal factors  that students experience when they abandon their university studies, and it needs to be analyzed  in terms of the specific geographical and socio-economic contexts. For example, in the context  of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA), which includes Spain, the opening up of areas  of free movement of workers and the transparency and transferability of university degrees is  also a factor that has generated a global adaptation of the university system, of its organization  in the European Credits Tansfer System (ECTS) credit system, and of the teaching methodologies  appropriate for competence-based training ( Gijón Puerta and Crisol Moya, 2012 ;   Lizarte and  Gijón, 2019 ).  Early dropout affects all areas of knowledge and all higher education institutions, both  public and private. Its influence on the survival of university institutions is also high – especially  in private institutions – and it occupies the education policy agendas of developed countries and  OPEN ACCESS  EDITED BY  Antonio Hernandez Fernandez,  University of Jaén, Spain  REVIEWED BY  Isabel Martínez-Sánchez,  National University of Distance Education  (UNED), Spain  Ángel Custodio Mingorance-Estrada,  Universidad Granada, Spain  *CORRESPONDENCE  Emilio J.

In the case of the European Union, the so-called  2030 Agenda has set targets related to the reduction of early school  leaving, as a generic concept in this case, comprising the population  aged 18–24 who are not in or have dropped out of tertiary education.  In terms of university dropouts, the most recent data from the  Spanish Ministry of Universities put the dropout rate at between  13 and 11% – for those under 30   years of age – of students at  Spanish universities who entered in the 2015/16 academic year.  These figures are like those of other OECD countries ( Fernández  Mellizo, 2022 ) and represent a strong negative impact on the  quality of higher education. This study indicates as factors involved  in early drop-out (between the first, second and third year for  4-year degrees), some family or individual factors, academic  performance in the first year of the degree, tuition fees, age and  socio-economic level. Courses requiring fewer qualifications for  entry have higher drop-out rates, and the size of the university also  seems to be related to drop-out rates (the larger the university, the  higher the drop-out rate).  The international literature has progressively included different  views on drop-out in higher education. For this reason, a brief  terminological clarification is needed. Having a single definition of  “University Desertion” is certainly complicated, as there are different  perspectives on abandonment and multiple factors that can influence  the decision to drop out. International literature provides various  conceptualizations of the phenomenon of student abandonment,  including terms such as desertion, retention and persistence ( Bäulke  et al., 2022 ) or procastination ( Bäulke et al., 2021 ). These terms are  defined differently, although they are sometimes used interchangeably.  Generally speaking, “level of retention” refers to the rate at which  students remain at a given institution, while “persistence” refers to the  completion of a degree and the award of a qualification, irrespective  of whether they have changed institution or degree.  Different authors have approached the concept of dropout from  different perspectives. For example,   González and Uribe (2002)   has  presented dropouts according to: their duration – temporary dropouts  are called partial and permanent dropouts are called total – and  according to whether they affect a university or the entire higher  education system – institutional dropouts are associated with a single  institution, and systemic dropouts when they involve leaving higher  education for good. –.  In relation to the point in time at which desertion occurs, the  threshold applied varies: from using the time of desertion regardless  of when it occurs, to using 3, 2, or 1   year desertion data ( Fernández  Mellizo, 2022 ). In this sense, a large part of the studies on dropout  have agreed that university dropout occurs mainly in the first year  ( Corominas Rovira, 2001 ;   Pierella et al., 2020 ;   Wild and Heuling,  2020 ). The first weeks of school are decisive because there is a higher  risk of dropping out due to the multitude of internal and external  factors that intervene in the course of adaptation, which is more  accentuated among students with lower degrees of self-perception and  regulation in psychosocial and academic areas ( Lizarte Simón and  Gijón Puerta, 2022 ).  Tinto (1982)   defines dropout as a situation faced by a student who  aspires to and fails to complete his or her educational project at  university, and a dropout as a student who has no academic activity  for three consecutive semesters. We will use this concept of “desertion,”  focusing on university drop-out in the first and second year of a  degree programme.  The literature of the last four decades has generated very different  explanatory models of the process of student drop-out in higher  education. Since the 1960s, a wide variety of models have been  developed to try to explain dropout in higher education, which are  grouped into different perspectives: psychological, sociological,  structural and organizational, adaptation (integration), psycho-  pedagogical, structural perspective, adaptation (integration), ability to  pay, or link, nexus and university choice ( Berlanga et al., 2018 ; see  Figure 1 ).  Based on recent reviews of the existing literature on explanatory  models of dropout ( Figuera Gazo and Torrado Fonseca, 2012 ;   Torrado  Fonseca, 2012 ;   Berlanga et al., 2018 ;   Torrado Fonseca and Figuera  Gazo, 2019 ) it is possible to establish the existence of a solid body of  doctrine on dropout in higher education. The Student Integration  Model developed by   Spady (1970) ,   Tinto (2010) ,   and   do Nicoletti  (2019) ,   and Bean’s Student Attrition Model ( Bean and Metzner, 1985 )  will be the two basic models from which the research on dropout,  integration, attrition and dessertion has been developed in higher  education,   organized   around   several   factors   that   each   model  structures differently.  Irrespective of the models we select, several factors related to  dropout in higher education are recurrent. Thus, based on the work  of Lizarte and other authors in the international sphere ( Lizarte,  2017b ,   2020 ;   Barroso et al., 2022 ;   Lizarte Simón and Gijón Puerta,  FIGURE 1  Dimensions grouping the explanatory models of dropout and  authors related to each dimension.

Gijón et al.   10.3389/feduc.2023.1130194  Frontiers in   Education   07   frontiersin.org  history from a practical point of view. It was simply a matter of  absorbing knowledge and then translating it into an exam). The  transparency and transferability of the degrees is questioned in some  cases because «se suponía que ibas a convalidar medio curso, luego no  convalidaron nada, me voy a Murcia y ya tuve una lesión que luego no  pude terminar tampoco los exámenes» (CA01) (you were supposed  to validate half a course, then nothing was validated, I went to Murcia  and I had an injury and then I could not finish the exams either).  In some cases, it is the degree that is considered a mistake: «aparte  de que ni una asignatura, ni una carrera que me llenaba» (JA03) (apart  from the fact that neither a subject, nor the studies that made me  happy,” leaving «porque no me gustaba la carrera. Me equivoqué  cuando me metí. No era lo que yo esperaba» (AL01) (because I did not  like the courses. I was wrong when I got into it. It was not what  I expected). And this fact is usually associated with «no encontrar  significatividad a lo que estaba haciendo y de no encontrar una  motivación   y   una   fuente   de   orientación   dentro   del   sistema  universitario» (JA04) (not finding significance to what I was doing and  not finding a motivation and a source of orientation within the  university system).  Motivation   appears   recurrently   in   the   perceptions   of   the  interviewees: JA06 affirms that he dropped out «porque me faltaba  motivación, al no obtener los resultados» (because I lacked motivation,  because I did not get the results); MA02 affirms that «el último año de  la universidad pues ya prácticamente como no estaba motivado fue  cuando un poco abandoné el tema de los estudios y me enfoqué a vivir  la vida» (in the last year of university, since I was practically not  motivated, that was when I abandoned the subject of studies and  focused on living life). GR03 presents it clearly when he states that  «realmente, estoy pensando, creo que no llegué a presentarme ningún  examen de primero, pero que tampoco me puse a preparármelo como  tal» (In fact, I’m thinking, I do not think I took any exams in my first  year, but I did not prepare for them as such).  Integration and commitment also appear frequently in the  participants’ accounts. In some cases, the focus is on teachers and  peers   («escasa   atención   por   parte   del   profesorado   y   poca  sociabilización entre compañeros» JA10; «era una gente ultra  egoísta, nada más que queriendo presumir sus logros en vez de  intentar aprender o enseñar y tal iban a presumir» GR04) (“little  attention from teachers and little socializing among peers” JA10;  “they were ultra-selfish people, just wanting to show off their  achievements instead of trying to learn or teach and so on” GR04).  In others, they recognize their own lack of commitment and  academic and social integration: JA12 indicates that «no iba a todas  las asignaturas al día, no estudiaba como tal de manera intensa,  dedicándole un gran número de horas al día hasta que no se iba  FIGURE 8  Representation of self-coding based on feelings.

Our findings are generally consistent with the existence of  these same factors as the ultimate cause or determinant of early  dropout in the first 2   years of a university degree.  Returning to the factors presented at the beginning of this  document as a result of recent literature reviews ( Berlanga, 2014 ;  Lizarte, 2020 ;   Barroso et al., 2022 ;   Lizarte Simón and Gijón Puerta,  2022 ), we will mark those that appear in our research after analyzing  the content of the 23 semi-structured interviews that form it (see  Figure 10 , in grey the dropout factors that appear in our study).  First, we can say that there are no differences associated with the  age or gender of the research participants, as well as with anxiety levels  or mental health. Nor does the academic level of the parents seem to  be related to the dropout factors in our case.  Secondly, economic factors are indeed reflected in several of the  individuals interviewed, which seems to justify the concern to increase  support for students through new scholarship policies in Spain  ( Fernández Mellizo, 2022 ).  Thirdly, factors linked to the student’s academic and social  integration and academic commitment remain essential factors in  explaining the decision to drop out.  Looking at the results in the various dimensions, we can compare  with some previous results in other research.  As for the dimension related to “Biographical and socio-  demographic attributes,” it is worth noting that we   found no  indications regarding the influence of gender on the decision to drop  out, unlike other studies, which did find significant differences ( Almås  et al., 2016 ;   Isphording and Qendrai, 2019 ).  Within the dimension “Self-perceptions prior to entry into  university studies” appears in our research the item “Perception of  control and academic competence,” which is frequent in research that  focuses on technological or natural science-related careers ( Respondek  et al., 2017 ,   2020 ).  In the “Goals and commitment” dimension, an interesting  variable – especially in the Spanish context, which is frequently  reported in the literature – is the “Order of career choice,” since in our  country, due to the scholarship policy, it is not very expensive to wait  a year studying a degree that is not the first choice ( Zumárraga-  Espinosa et al., 2018 ;   Contreras, 2021 ).  Within the dimension “Experiences in the institution,” our study  collects different factors. Scores obtained in university studies” have  been recognized in previous studies and are now being used as a  predictor of dropout, using learning machines ( Solis et al., 2018 ).  Time spent studying” also appears frequently in studies on dropout  ( Respondek et al., 2017 ) using also big data in the case of e-learning  ( Liang and Yang, 2016 ).  Finally, “Academic and social integration” is a dimension  that is reflected in our study with different factors already  referred to in the literature (Scholastic Conscientiousness,  Satisfaction with academic and social integration, Learning  strategies, Time management, Class attendance, satisfaction with  courses and curriculum), and it also appears in many previous  and current studies, so we deduce that it continues to be one of  the important factors in the decision to leave, as indicated by  different authors, both in Spain and internationally ( Álvarez  et al., 2016 ;   Kehm et al., 2019 ;   Aina et al., 2021 ;   Piepenburg and  Beckmann, 2022 ).  One issue that can perhaps be associated with the Spanish context  is the frequency with which participants recommend attending  VET-related courses before going on to university studies. In this  sense, the existence of a higher number of university students in Spain  than in other EU countries, to the detriment of higher vocational  training studies, may justify part of the drop-out rate in terms of  expectations not fulfilled by university education (practical training,  immediate job placement, etc.).  This may be related to the need for more vocational guidance  prior to university entrance.  In conclusion, the findings of our study do not differ from those  of other geographical contexts and are generally in line with the  factors or causes of early dropout that have been clearly established in  the literature in recent decades. It is up to educational policies and  higher education institutions to implement the processes of teacher  training, curricular reorganization and academic and vocational  guidance that, on a case-by-case basis, can help to reduce the risk of  early leaving.

Materials and methods  The abandonment of university studies is a problem that affects  the balance and correct organization of university systems throughout  the world and that has undesirable personal consequences in advanced  societies. Dropping out of school has a multidimensional explanation.  Among the causes, associated with each other, that originate it, the  following factors stand out: psychological, social, economic, psycho-  pedagogical, institutional, and didactic. Studying how all these  dimensions act and relate to each other in specific cases of people who  drop out of Higher Education, helps us to better understand the  phenomenon and to develop prevention measures in university  institutions ( Figure 3 ).  The problem of university dropout affects all universities, although  it occurs with different intensities –BBVA Foundation Report– ( Pérez  and Aldás, 2019 ). According to the U-Ranking – Spanish Universities  report, the differences in dropout rates by region reach 19 percentage  points in the case of bachelor’s degrees and 13 points in the dropout  rate of SUE (Spanish University System). The highest dropout rate by  the regions is led by the Canary Islands with a value of 38.8%, while  the lowest dropout rate is in Castilla y León with 19.6%. In the  Andalusian case, the dropout rate stands at 28.5%.  The degree dropout rate by year of dropout and Andalusian  university (Cohort 2012–2013) is Almería: 29.2%; Cadiz: 34.8%;  Cordoba: 27.2%; Grenada: 27.2%; Huelva: 33%; Jaén: 29.7%; Malaga:  28.8%; Pablo de Olavide: 18.5%; Seville: 27.8%. As we can see, the  Pablo de Olavide University presents the lowest dropout rate of the  Andalusian universities with 18.5%; while the University of Cádiz  presents the highest rate with 34.8%. The University of Granada  presents a rate of 27.2%, which can be classified as a high rate.  There are several strategies that university institutions carry out  to overcome the phenomenon of dropout, but there is no general  protocol for action in cases of possible dropout ( Lizarte Simón and  Gijón Puerta, 2022 ). Based on the latest reports from various  Andalusian universities, the creation of Guidance Units in faculties is  presented as one of the aid plans that work best to remedy cases of  abandonment. Guidance is part of the educational process and has  become an indicator of the quality and functioning of university  systems   ( Vidal   et   al.,   2002 ).This   text   presents   the   results   of  biographical-narrative research carried out among the student  population in a situation of abandonment of the universities of  Andalusia that has allowed us to recover 22 stories of abandonment  carried out by as many ex-students who were enrolled in any of the  nine universities. Andalusians publish in any of the different university  degree studies. The biographical texts have been subjected to narrative  analysis to achieve personal exemplifications and characterize  paradigmatic cases of relationship between the dimensions of the  problem, using concept mapping to present the outcomes.  Using NVivo ®   word frequency queries, we can list the words that  occur most frequently in certain resources, in this case the transcripts  of the interviews conducted. To refine the search, it has been screened  by a minimum length of five letters, which is considered relevant for  the Spanish language. Likewise, to avoid sterile repetition, derived  words have been grouped and, finally, empty words (articles,  prepositions, common verbs, etc.) have been eliminated. This query  allows different visualizations: the branching map and the word cloud,  which indicate – proportionally with the size – the presence of words;  and the cluster analysis, which groups words according to their  similarity of occurrence in the different files.  On the one hand, the word frequency query was used to: (a)  Create a word cloud to visualize the concepts used in adequate  proportion; (b) Define the general feeling that the process of making  the abandonment decision linked to their biographical trajectory  implied (self-coding by feelings); (c) Create a library of dropout-  related keywords, which can serve as a basis for future discourse  analysis of university dropout, using software such as Yoshikoder ®  ( Lowe, 2006 ; automatic autocoding).  On the other hand, a direct narrative reconstruction of the CAB  dimension (Causes of dropout) was carried out to establish the most  frequently reported dropout factors and to compare them with those  established in the literature review. The inductive categorization of the  CON dimension (Suggestions and advice) was also carried out. The  resulting information was reworked by the research team in a  collaborative way, in the form of a narrative reconstruction of the causes  of drop-out and in the form of a conceptual map. – Concept Mapping   by  Novak– ( González García et   al., 2013 ;   Ibáñez et   al., 2014 ), thus  establishing a “knowledge model” generated with the key elements and  their agreed relationships within the research team ( González García  et al., 2013 ) for the causes and advice that participating students give to  participating institutions and other students.  The sample consisted of a total of 23 interviews. Sampling was  criterion   sampling,   based   on   the   subject’s   “accessibility”   and  acceptance of the research conditions. The demographic structure of  the sample is presented in   Figure 4 , including 16 men and 7 women,  students from the universities of Almeria, Cadiz, Granada, Cordoba,  Jaen and Malaga, from careers related to experimental and biomedical  sciences, social sciences, humanities and technical careers. The  interviews were labeled with a number associated with the university  where the dropout occurred AL01, CA01, GR01-03-04-05-06-07-09,  JA01-02-03-04-06-07-08-09-10-11-12-13, MA02.
