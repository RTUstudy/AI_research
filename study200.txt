This study aimed to develop an  academic locus of control (ALoC) measure. Participants were 432 Italian university  students (69 males, 363 females) pursuing bachelor’s ( N   = 339) and master’s  ( N   = 123) degrees in Italy. The ALoC scale resulted in two factors, internal (6 items)  and external ALoC (12 items), which demonstrated satisfactory dimensionality and  invariance across students’ gender and attending degree. Internal and external  ALoC were, respectively, negatively, and positively associated with academic  dropout. This study confirmed the importance of locus of control for academic  achievement,   suggesting   that   university   programs   should   address   students’  personal sense of failure while promoting a sense of mastery and responsibility  for academic outcomes.  KEYWORDS  locus of control, academic achievement, dropout, university students, higher education  Introduction  The locus of control is an important predictor of academic achievement and dropout.  Having an internal rather than external locus of control can positively affect constancy in  studies. This research aims to develop and validate a measure for academic internal and external  academic locus of control in university students. To this purpose, two studies were conducted.  The first study explored the latent structure of the data to determine the number of latent  dimensions of the scale. The second study tested the dimensionality of the scale, its replicability,  and concurrent validity.  Academic locus of control  Several countries in Europe are characterized by high percentages of students’ dropout in  higher education ( Vossensteyn et al., 2015 ). Italy is one of the countries with the lowest rates of  graduates and the highest rates of university dropout ( Istat, 2019 ;   Eurostat, 2020 ). Constructing  reliable measures able to identify the factors that promote academic achievement represents a  fundamental strategy for improving the Europe standards of higher education.

Morelli et al.   10.3389/feduc.2023.1268550  Frontiers in   Education   02   frontiersin.org  Previous research found an important role of locus of control  (LoC) in predicting academic achievement and dropout ( Joo et al.,  2013 ;   Kovach, 2018 ). LoC has been defined as the belief regarding  one’s level of control over one’s life outcomes ( Rotter, 1966 ).  Individuals who attribute their life outcomes as depending on their  behavior have an internal LoC, whereas individuals who perceive that  life outcomes depend on environmental factors have an external LoC  ( Galvin et   al., 2018 ).   Levenson (1973 ,   1981)   conceived LoC as  composed of three dimensions: internal, powerful others, and chance.  According to this model, people with an external LoC may perceive  that their life is controlled by powerful others or rather that events are  unpredictable and determined by chance ( Levenson, 1981 ).  Locus of control (LoC) represents a pivotal construct concerning  performance   within   achievement   contexts.   Consequently,  contemporary psychological research has exhibited a growing interest  in comprehending its predictive significance across diverse domains,  including the realms of employment ( Ng et al., 2006 ), higher education  ( Ghasemzadeh, 2011 ), and health-related outcomes ( Kesavayuth et al.,  2020 ). Given that the academic domain serves as an exemplary  context for the pursuit of various outcomes, it becomes imperative to  investigate the role of LoC within this specific sphere.  Rotter (1975)   proposed that greater predictive accuracy within  specific contexts could be   achieved through the development of  context-specific measurement scales. Subsequently, in 1985, Trice  developed the Academic Locus of Control Scale for College Students,  which offered a valuable instrument for exploring students’ LoC  within the academic domain. The work of   Trice’s (1985)   provided a  clear definition of academic LoC, characterizing it as a set of  expectations concerning the influence of one’s efforts and behaviors  on academic performance. In 2013, Curtis and Trice conducted a  study aimed at revisiting the scale’s structure and validity, 30   years after  its initial development, resulting in an updated version of this  measurement tool. Both the original scale and its updated version  utilized a True/False response format, which posed a potential  limitation in capturing the full spectrum of participants’ responses.  For what concern the Italian context, several prior studies have  established the predictive power of LoC on various academic variables,  including learning ( Cascio et al., 2013 ), academic self-efficacy ( Sagone  and Caroli, 2014 ), and procrastination ( Sagone and Indiana, 2021 ).  Notably, these studies relied on generic measurement tools for LoC,  primarily due to the absence of a dedicated scale specifically designed  for assessing academic locus of control. The existence of a specific  measure of academic LoC can provide researchers with a more precise  and   comprehensive   understanding   of   the   role   of   LoC   in  educational outcomes.  Current study  This research aimed to develop a measure for academic internal  and external LoC in university students. Specifically, it was intended  to create a contemporary measurement scale, drawing upon the  foundations of prior instruments that have demonstrated robust  construct validity and reliability. In doing so, we provided participants  with the option to respond using a Likert scale, as opposed to a  dichotomous true/false format. The adoption of the Likert scale offers  a more comprehensive and nuanced insight into participants’  responses, enabling the capture of the full spectrum of variance in  their answers. Consequently, this approach provides enhanced  opportunities for conducting correlational analyses and delving  deeper into the data.  To this end, the Levenson scale was adapted to the academic  context, leaving the item structure unchanged while replacing generic  concepts such as “life” or “interests” with academic-related concepts  such as “academic success” or “exam outcomes.” The scale was then  administered to university students through two studies: The first was  conducted to explore the latent structure of the scale and its reliability;  the second was performed to confirm the scale dimensionality and test  the invariance of the structure across gender (males versus females)  and students attending degree, such as Bachelor of Art (BA) vs. Master  of Art (MA), running a multigroup Confirmative Factor Analysis  (CFA). Furthermore, the concurrent validity of the scale was tested  investigating the association with the intention to dropout.  Method  Study 1  The aim of the first study was to explore the latent structure of  the data to determine the number of latent dimensions of the scale.  Therefore, an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was performed.  Further item analysis was conducted to assess the reliability of the  scales as emerged from the EFA. The study was approved by the  Ethics Committee of the Department of Sapienza, University of  Rome. Informed consent was obtained from all the participants  included in the study.  Participants  Participants of the study consisted of 206 University students (36  males and 170 females), with an average age of 22.9 y.o. (SD   =   4.97).  One hundred and forty-two participants were attending a BA, whereas  64 were attending a MA.  Instruments  The Academic Locus of Control (AloC) scale of 24 items was  administered. Participants had to answer to each item with a 5-point  Likert scale that ranged from (1) Completely disagree to (5)  Completely agree. Items wording and psychometrics are showed in  the result section ( Table 1 ).  Results  An Explorative Factor Analysis (EFA) on the initial 24 items of the  scale was performed to investigate the latent structure of the data  (Principal Axis Factoring). Assumptions check on the correlation  matrix revealed that Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity was statistically  significant, chi-square (153)   =   1,174,   p   <   0.001, outlining that items  were correlated enough so that the correlation matrix diverges  significantly from the identity matrix. Both scree-plot and eigenvalue  greater than 1 suggested a two-factor solution (first eight eigenvalues  were: 5.18, 1.56, 0.78, 0.59, 0.39, 0.33, 0.33, and 0.21). After Oblimin  rotation, the factor loading matrix was examined. Six items with high  factor loadings on both factors (greater than 0.40), or which loaded  lower than 0.40 on one factor, were deleted from the analysis (items  #9, 13, 17, 8, 24, 5). Afterwards, the EFA was run on the remaining 18  items. The two-factor solution was once again confirmed by the scree

Discussion  The present study was aimed at developing and validating a  measure to investigate AloC in university students based on previous  scales of LoC ( Levenson, 1973 ,   1981 ). While Levenson scale consisted  of three dimensions, the AloC scale resulted in two factors meeting  the criteria of the internal (6 items) and external AloC (12 items),  where the latter included the two dimensions of powerful others and  chance. Explorative analysis revealed a final scale composed of  18 items.  The second study confirmed the factor model of the AloC and its  generalizability. The two factors were confirmed by the invariance  across students’ gender and attending degree. Males and females, as  well as BA and MA students, assigned the same interpretations to  external and internal AloC. Consistently with previous research,  internal and external AloC resulted, respectively, negatively, and  positively associated with the intention to dropout ( Arslan and Akin,  2014 ). Internal AloC can be   considered a protective factor for  university students as it relates to academic achievement, motivation,  and success ( Anderson and Hamilton, 2005 ;   Gifford et al., 2006 ;  Ghasemzadeh, 2011 ). On the contrary, external AloC can hinder the  university path as it relates to poor academic aspiration, low-grade  point average, absenteeism, and academic withdrawal ( Nordstrom  and Segrist, 2009 ;   Landrum, 2010 ).  Students with internal AloC exert more effort compared to those  with external AloC due to their belief in their ability to influence  university outcomes. The AloC proved to be a good instrument to  understand the extent to which students attribute their academic  success or failure to their commitment. Such understanding equips  educators with the potential to predict academic outcomes and  proactively guide students toward success.  Conclusion  In Europe, the academic career is generally pictured as an  important and prestigious developmental task to achieve for young  adults. However, there is a lack of attention on those factors that may  TABLE 4   Multigroup confirmative factor analysis and comparison  between the models of measurement invariance (BA vs. MA).

The  innovative aspect of the present study lies in the development of a  scale that measures the orientation of internal or external LoC within  the academic domain. Prior research has employed generic scales of  locus of control, such as Rotter’s Internal-External Locus of Control  Scale ( Rotter, 1966 ) and Levenson’s Questionnaire ( Levenson, 1973 ),  to assess LoC. In other cases, specific scales on academic LoC have  been used but, to date, can be considered dated in some of their  aspects ( Trice, 1985 ;   Akin, 2007 ;   Curtis and Trice, 2013 ). To the best  of our knowledge, this study is the first to introduce and validate a  scale for measuring AloC after a significant time gap since the revision  and validation of previous instruments. Furthermore, the AloC scale  introduced in this study is grounded in Levenson’s original scale  pertaining to the LoC construct. This approach ensures a robust  conceptual framework encompassing both the external and internal  dimensions of the construct while tailoring it to the unique context of  the academic setting.  Additionally,   the   factorial   structure   of   the   AloC   scale  demonstrated robustness and consistency across students’ gender and  degree programs. This finding suggests that the AloC scale exhibits  validity   and   reliability   across   diverse   groups,   thus   further  strengthening the overall validity and generalizability of the AloC  scale. Ultimately, the AloC is presented as an instrument that is easy  and quick to administer, yet comprehensive. From our perspective, the  scale presented in this study represents an outstanding tool for  assessing and comparing AloC within university environments,  eliminating   the   need   for   employing   multiple   instruments  simultaneously   and   ensuring   that   the   items   are   perceived   as  representative across diverse student groups.  Implications for practice  The development and validation of the AloC scale offer a valuable  tool for early identification of students who may be at greater risk of  dropping out of university. As our study has shown, students with  external AloC tendencies tend to exhibit characteristics such as poor  academic aspiration, low-grade point averages, absenteeism, and  academic withdrawal—factors strongly associated with the intention  to drop out. Identifying these students early in their academic career  can enable timely interventions to provide the necessary support and  resources to improve their academic outcomes.  Academic dropout is generally experienced as a personal failure  that negatively impacts the overall quality of the university experience  ( Heublein and Wolter, 2011 ;   Cattelino et al., 2021 ;   Morelli et al.,  2023a , b ). University programs should reduce the personal sense of  failure and improve the sense of mastery and responsibility of students  in academic outcomes. Understanding the significance of AloC is  fundamental to improving achievement within the context of higher  education ( Morelli et al., 2021 ). Integrating the notion of autonomy  and responsibility for achievement into programs can enhance  students’ academic engagement and retention.  Incorporating the AloC scale into university programs could  enhance the effectiveness of prevention and intervention strategies.  For instance, academic advisors, counselors, and educators could use  this scale to assess a student’s orientation towards internal or external  AloC. Based on the results, personalized interventions and supportive  trainings can be tailored to promote students’ academic motivation  and sense of mastery. Empowering students with a sense of personal  agency and control over their academic outcomes can contribute to  reducing the feelings of personal failure often associated with  academic dropout.

Morelli et al.   10.3389/feduc.2023.1268550  Frontiers in   Education   04   frontiersin.org  Instruments  The final reduced version of the AloC scale of 18 items was  administered. The items of the scales were given in   Table 1 . Intention  to dropout of university was measured using a six-item scale based on  an earlier-developed measure by   Bonino et al. (2005)   and already used  in previous studies ( Morelli et al., 2021 ,   2023b ). An example item is:  “Have you ever seriously thought about dropping out of university?.”  Participants had to answer each item of the questionnaires with a  5-point Likert scale that ranged from (1) Completely disagree to (5)  Completely agree. The total score, obtained summing the scores of  each item, was used. The Cronbach’s Alpha was 0.77 and McDonald’s  Omega was 0.79.  Results  A CFA was conducted to test the structure of the scale in an  independent sample, showing good fit indexes, chi-square (8)   =   24.4,  p   =   0.002, CFI   =   0.98, TLI   =   0.96, SRMR   =   0.036, RMSEA   =   0.069.  Measurement invariance across gender was then assessed. Firstly,  we examined the configural invariance (M 0 ), i.e., an unconstrained  baseline model in which all parameters freely differ between males  and females’ students. Secondly, the metric invariance was examined  (M 1 ), i.e., a model in which all factor loadings are simultaneously  constrained across gender groups. Finally, the scalar invariance M 2  was tested, i.e., a model in which the intercepts are constrained to  be   equal across groups. As can be   noted in Table 3 , all models  exhibited good fit indexes.  All nested models were formally contrasted via the   Δχ 2  comparison. The comparison M 1   versus M 0   showed a non-significant  Δχ 2 : this result suggests no significant group differences for factor  loadings supporting metric invariance ( Table 3 ). In other words,  males and females’ students attributed the same meaning to the  latent constructs under investigation. Furthermore, both the M 0   and  M 1   were also tested and compared to the scalar invariance model  M 2 . Result always showed a non-significant   Δχ 2 . Therefore, scalar  invariance was supported meaning that also the levels of the  underlying   items   (intercepts)   may   be   considered   equal   in  both groups.  The same pattern of analyses was replicated considering BA vs.  MA students as grouping variable. Results are reported in   Table 4  confirming the measurement invariance of the scale also for these  two groups.  Internal consistency for both scales were satisfactory and  Cronbach’s Alpha and McDonald’s Omega substantially converged.  External AloC had an Alpha of 0.83 and an Omega of 0.84, while  Internal AloC showed an Alpha of 0.77 and an Omega of 0.79. An  item analysis for each item was performed revealing that none of the  items would increase the reliability of each of the scales in case it  would have been dropped out.  Concurrent validity was tested against an external academic  outcome, namely intentions to dropout the university career. At  bivariate level, it was found that External AloC was positively related  to dropout,   r   =   0.30,   p   <   0.001, while Internal AloC was negatively  related,   r   =   − 0.21,   p   <   0.001. A SEM with latent variables was  performed to test the predictions including External AloC and  Internal AloC as exogenous variables and dropout as endogenous  variable. The model exhibited good fit indexes, chi-square (24)   =   24.4,  TABLE 2   Item reliability statistics of the academic locus of control scales.
