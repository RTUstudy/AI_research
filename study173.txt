Frontiers in   Education   01   frontiersin.org  Analysis of the determinant  factors in university dropout: a  case study of Ecuador  Aracelly Fernanda Núñez-Naranjo  1 , 2 *  1  Centro de Investigación en Ciencias Humanas y de la Educación - CICHE, Facultad de Ciencias de la  Educación, Carrera de Educación Básica, Universidad Tecnológica Indoamérica, Ambato, Ecuador,  2  Carrera de Educación Básica, Universidad Tecnológica Indoamérica, Ambato, Ecuador  University dropout is a social issue that directly impacts both families and the  state, characterized by disparities in enrollment and graduation based on various  factors. The primary objective of this study was to analyze the determinants of  university dropout supported by multifactorial analysis at a private university in  Ecuador. This research was conducted within a post-positivist paradigm with a  quantitative approach, utilizing digitized statistical records of students and results  from a personalized survey sent to dropouts via email. Out of a total of 1,078  students admitted and/or enrolled over 5 years, a sample was analyzed from  the 484 who dropped out. Student dropout is associated with personal, familial,  economic, academic, and institutional factors, contributing to school abandonment  with an estimated probability of 44.90%. In conclusion, a higher dropout rate was  observed among male students from public institutions who did not complete  the first cycle, despite having a higher number of enrollments at the university.  Finally, the Multilevel Logistic Regression model can predict with 76.44% accuracy  the behavior of the independent variables affecting school dropout.  KEYWORDS  university dropout, determinants of dropout, Ecuadorian higher education, student  retention, multifactorial analysis  1 Introduction  University dropout represents a global challenge with significant social, economic, and  political repercussions, emphasizing educational inequality that restricts access and graduation  for a limited number of students ( Enguídanos et al., 2023 ;   Lorenzo-Quiles et al., 2023 ;   Mascia  et al., 2023 ). Despite efforts made to reduce this issue from the 1970s to the present, the  dropout rate has shown alarming persistence, especially in developing countries. Globally, the  European Union, for instance, worked in 2020 on plans to increase the graduation rate of the  population aged 30 to 34, reducing the percentage of people without tertiary education by 40%  ( De La Cruz-Campos et al., 2023 ). In Spain, 20% of the population that begins their studies  drops out at the initial levels, decreasing as they advance in their careers. Italy has high  university dropout rates ( Álvarez Ferrandiz, 2021 ;   Delogu et al., 2024 ).  In Latin America, university dropout rates have been notably high, reaching 47% in  2007 and 50% in 2012, with the Dominican Republic at 76%, Bolivia at 73.3%, and Uruguay  at 72% ( Al-hawamdeh and Alam, 2022 ;   Martelo et   al., 2017 ). Investment in higher  education, both in scientific and technological aspects, plays a crucial role in this problematic  situation. Policies in Colombia and Chile have contributed to a 50% increase in dropout  rates due to political conflicts and social movements that affect academic stability, while in  OPEN ACCESS  EDITED BY  Ana B.

Núñez-Naranjo   10.3389/feduc.2024.1444534  Frontiers in   Education   04   frontiersin.org  analyzing the determining factors causing university dropout, a case  study of Ecuador.  3 Methodology  This research employs a quantitative approach methodology  grounded in the post-positivist paradigm. This is a case study on  student dropout in a private university in Ecuador, considering the  available digitalized information from the institution on categorized  and coded variables such as: age at entry, marital status, gender,  ethnicity, region of origin, type of school, type of family, income  quintile, level of study, selected major, campus, and study modality.  These variables are associated with five specific factors: familial,  personal, economic, academic, and institutional, as shown in   Table 1 .  3.1 Data collection and organization  For data collection, the technique of document review was  employed, focusing on the available digital historical records of 1,078  students who were admitted and enrolled during the 2014–2019  period. This information was obtained from the Academic Student  Information System (SIAE) and an institutional survey sent via email  to a sample of 484 students who dropped out. The instruments used  included tabulated data records and a questionnaire that asked for the  reasons for dropping out based on the aforementioned factors. These  students (both men and women) were aged between 17 and 58   years  and graduated from both public and private secondary education  institutions located in various regions of the country. A noteworthy  aspect is that these students pursued their studies either in-person or  semi-presential   at   the   Main   Campus/Headquarters   or   the  Extension Branches.  The detailed information from the SIAE facilitated the distribution  of the population, which was divided into five categories: A  (graduates), B (active students), C (students who changed majors), D  (re-enrolled students), and E (students who dropped out).  Category A refers to graduates, who are students who have  completed their studies and graduated, totaling 186 students. Category  B includes students who are still in university without having  graduated, despite repeating one or more levels, and this group  consists of 279 students. Category C encompasses those who have  decided to change majors within the same university, with 23 students.  Category D refers to re-entered students, totaling 106. Finally,  Category E represents the dropouts, which includes students who  permanently withdrew from the university. This group comprises 484  students and was considered the sample for the in-depth descriptive  study. The distribution is shown in   Table 2 .  For the interpretation of the results, a descriptive analysis was first  applied, and for greater consistency in predictive analysis, tabulation,  diagramming, and application of the Multilevel Logistic Regression  model   Constate-Amores et al. (2020)   were used. This study covered  both the “Main Campus” and the “Extension/Branch” locations of the  institution, considering the student population enrolled in both face-  to-face and semi-face-to-face modalities. For the initial comparative  descriptive analysis, information associated with personal, familial,  economic, academic, and institutional conditions was extracted,  compiled based on the references consulted that have addressed the  issue of dropout based on student decision and/or persistence or  retention, seen from the institution’s perspective. The selected factors  are detailed in   Table 2 .  In the second phase, a predictive model was configured supported  by determining the significant variables related to the characteristics  and entry conditions of the students entering the university. Prior to  this, an inquiry was conducted into the relationship of each of the  explanatory variables (independent variables) with the student  retention variable (dependent variable) of the students at the university  under study, by applying the Chi-square Test and Fischer’s Exact Test  (categorized qualitative variables) based on the frequency reflected in  the contingency tables generated using the IBM SPSS v29 program.  The main condition of the model is that the binary dependent  variable Y takes the code values of 1 if the student drops out and 0 if  they remain (retained).  The independent variables of the study will be identified as X1,  X2, X3, ..., Xi. In this context, the model designed to fulfill the  objective of determining the probability that the variable Y is 1, given  X1, X2, ..., Xi (P(Y | X1, X2, ..., Xi)) is:  P(Y | X1, X2, X3, ..., Xi)   =   g(X1, X2, X3, ..., Xi;   β ) where the  probabilistic function g is the link function with values between [0,1],  and its value depends on a vector of parameters   β , which in the case  of binary logistic regression is formulated as shown in   Equation (1) :  (   ) P. Y   Abandono   1 / Xi   1  iXi  iXi e e  β  β ∑ ∑ =   =   =   +   (1)  The explanatory variables of entry characteristics and conditions  (independent variables selected for this study) are extracted from  the record that was structured at the beginning of the admission  and enrollment processes of the cohorts and the annual student  characterization survey conducted by the institution’s admissions  department. The dependent variable is specified in   Table 3 , with a  value of 0 assigned to students who drop out and 1 assigned to  students who do not drop out (retained) in the regression model.  4 Results  4.1 Descriptive analysis of historical records  According to the proposed methodology, a summary of the  collected information on student data registered during the study  period is presented to make a comparison of the previously identified  categories. Despite the high dropout rate, a significant percentage of  graduates and continuing students are observed. However, the  majority of those who enroll fail to graduate, indicating that dropout  is a significant issue. The following categorical analysis is presented by  campus, modality, major, age, ethnicity, marital status, gender, region,  type of school, type of family, quintile, and level.  4.2 Pre-entry  4.2.1 Age-based  This category refers to the distribution by age, divided into two  groups. Young students aged 17–19 represent 26%, while those aged

Núñez-Naranjo   10.3389/feduc.2024.1444534  Frontiers in   Education   06   frontiersin.org  20–58 constitute 74%. Those who entered university at a young age  make up the majority of graduates and continuing students (24 and  30%, respectively). Meanwhile, students in categories D and E belong  to the older age group (10 and 49%, respectively). There is significant  diversity in terms of ages.  In Category E, which constitutes the study sample, 65 students  showed early or initial dropout upon admission but did not complete  their enrollment. Of these, 77% were over 30   years old, indicating that  retention challenges are more significant for this group. These data  provide a better understanding of the needs of students at different  stages of their academic life and the development of effective retention  and graduation strategies based on older age groups.  4.2.2 Ethnicity-based  The Afro-Ecuadorian population represents 0.28%, with the  majority of them belonging to Category D, showing a trend towards  withdrawal. White people constitute 1.11% and are more prevalent in  Category C. Indigenous people represent 1.86%. Mestizos represent  96.66%, and Montuvians represent 0.09%, with the majority of them  belonging to Category D.  Comparing Categories A, B, C, D, E reveals significant variations  in relation to ethnicity, with mestizos being the largest group in all  categories. Additionally, mestizos are the most successful group in  terms of graduation, while indigenous people manage to graduate  despite challenges and have a high representation in changing majors.  White people have a significant presence in Category B, indicating  their commitment to achieving their goals without dropping out.  Regarding reentries, Afro-Ecuadorians and Montuvians have low  proportions. These data highlight notable differences in educational  patterns among different ethnicities. Specifically analyzing Group E,  of the 65 students who dropped out early, the highest percentage of  dropout was reflected in the Montuvio ethnicity, with 48%.  4.2.3 According to marital status  The marital status “Single” is the most representative, covering  86.4% of the total population. In Category A, there is a relatively even  distribution in terms of marital status, with “Married” being the most  common at 19.1% and “Divorced” the least common at 10.0%. Category  B exhibits a more varied distribution, with “Married” being predominant  at 33.0%. In contrast, Category C shows generally low representation.  Category D presents a more even distribution, and Category E  reveals a higher representation of “Single” individuals, followed by  “Married” individuals (45.5 and 41.7% respectively). Categories A and  C show more uniform distributions in terms of marital status,  suggesting that these categories may depend less on individuals’ marital  status. On the other hand, Categories B and E demonstrate more  diverse distributions in terms of marital status. It appears that marital  status influences academic trajectories, as “Single” individuals achieve  higher academic outcomes in all categories. Although the population  of “Divorced” and “Widowed” individuals is small, they are present in  all categories. Among the 65 students who dropped out early, 64.61%  were married, 26.15% were divorced, and the remainder were single.  4.2.4 According to gender  The male gender had higher enrollment in 2014, representing  62.2%, compared to the female gender, which represented 37.8%. This  particularity emphasizes that for every woman entering university,  two men do so. In this category, a notable characteristic is presented,  as the dropout rate is higher among men than among women (48.9  and 38.3%, respectively), indicating that for every two male students  enrolled, at least one drops out, while for every three female students  enrolled, one drops out.  Despite the male gender having greater access to university, it is  women who graduate in greater numbers, stay longer in the  institution, and have lower dropout rates. This situation may  be influenced by robust trends. On the other hand, the male gender  shows a high dropout rate, a situation that could be attributed not only  to the process of adaptation and integration into the private university  environment but also to factors related to economics and other  personal, social, economic, institutional, and academic variables.  Regarding the early dropout of the 65 students who did not enroll,  70.76% were male, which aligns with the previously mentioned trend.  4.2.5 According to region  An unequal distribution of categories was detected across  different regions. The Sierra region has the largest population,  TABLE 3   Dependent variable of the study.

Núñez-Naranjo   10.3389/feduc.2024.1444534  Frontiers in   Education   07   frontiersin.org  followed by the Oriente and the Costa. In Category A, the Costa  region has the highest proportion of graduates, followed by the Sierra  and the Oriente (21.1, 17.9, and 7.5%, respectively). On the other  hand, Category E shows a higher incidence of students from the  Sierra, followed by Categories B, A, D, and C (43.6, 26.7, 17.9, 9.6, and  2.2%, respectively). Dropout and retention rates are notable in all  three   regions.   These   data   reflect   the   influence   of   students’  geographical location on their academic outcomes.  4.2.6 By type of school  Figure 1   shows that the majority of students enrolled in the first  level in 2014 primarily come from public schools, followed by private,  municipal, and state schools (48.9, 40.4, 5.6, and 5.1%, respectively).  In categories A, B, and D, students from public schools lead, followed  by students from private schools, while those from municipal and state  schools have relatively low percentages. In category E, dropout rates  are high among students from public schools and low among those  from private schools (51.7 and 38.8%, respectively). The type of school  attended by students has an impact on retention and dropout rates, as  high dropout rates are observed among students from public schools.  4.2.7 By type of family  Students who graduate most frequently primarily come from nuclear  and extended families (26.6 and 22.5%), the same is true in category B  (35.5 and 50.5%), and category D (13.6 and 16.2%), while those with the  lowest graduation and retention rates come from reconstructed families  (1.1 and 2.7%). The population in category C is not significant compared  to the other categories but shows similar trends to the previous categories.  In category E, there is a marked difference as dropouts primarily  come from reconstructed families, followed by separated families  (92.6 and 62.4%). Students from nuclear and extended families have  higher rates of graduation and retention, suggesting that a stable  family environment is important in the academic process. On the  other hand, those from separated and single-parent families show  higher rates of changing majors and re-entry, which may be related to  additional challenges they face within their families.  4.2.8 According to the quintile (quartile)  Students from the “High,” “Upper Middle,” and “Middle Typical”  quintiles seem to be associated as they tend to graduate (25, 21.4,  and 24.4%) and remain in higher proportions (41.7, 44.6, and  39.3%). Students from the “Low” quintile have higher rates in  categories C and D (40.0 and 60%). In Category E, there is a complex  relationship with the “Lower Middle,” “Middle Typical,” and “High”  quintiles, as they present relatively significant dropout rates (56.5,  14.3, and 33.3%). These findings suggest that quintiles may  be   associated   with   academic   performance   and   students’  academic decisions.  This identification of levels of wealth or poverty allows us to see  that the majority of students entering the institution do not have the  financial resources to sustain themselves and cover expenses at a  private university. This is primarily due to two reasons: first, students  who progress from one level to another often apply for admission to  other public institutions of higher education, and second, when they  do not pass a subject or semester, they must pay fees for credits that  are not budgeted, making it difficult to continue their higher education  and increasing the likelihood of dropping out.  4.3 Characteristics and behavior of data for  the post-admission stage  This section systematically presents information on students who  have passed the admission process and completed formal enrollment  at the university, totaling 419 students. Both frequency and percentage  distribution are specified for each segmented category of the study,  according to each factor and study variables. Among personal factors,  entry age stands out as more than 60% of students were over 20   years  old. Marital status is predominantly single at over 77%, and gender is  predominantly male at 60.38%. Additionally, 46.30% of these dropouts  belonged to the Montuvios ethnicity.  Regarding family information, 49.16% came from the coastal  region, with 74.22% having graduated from public secondary  education institutions and 40.81% belonging to extended families. In  terms of economic factors, the majority, 58.95%, were from the lower  quintile, while academic factors highlight that most dropouts, 52.98%,  occurred in the first cycle of the career. Finally, institutional factors  showed that the career with the highest dropout rate was Industrial  Engineering at 22.91%, with 57.52% belonging to the Main Campus,  where 72.08% studied in person.  The   following   table   details   all   specific   values   by   factor  and variables:  From   Table 4 , it can be observed that the factor with the highest  average percentage was personal type at 61.10%. The second highest  was the economic factor at 58.61%, while the family factor was third  with 54.63%, followed by the institutional factor at 50.84%, and lastly,  the academic factor with 10%. This suggests that dropout in the early  cycles of the career is attributed to factors related to prior education  before university entry.  In addition, the information received to date from students who  responded to the email survey was processed. The questionnaire  contained a single question asking students to indicate the factor  associated with their decision to abandon their university studies, with  personal, family, and economic problems ranking as the top three.  Figure 1   displays the percentage distribution of these factors.  4.4 Predictive analysis  Before conducting the multivariate analysis, the relationship  between the explanatory variables and university dropout or  retention was established by testing hypotheses for each case. Given  that the dependent variable Y (dropout or retention) is considered,  12 specific variables were analyzed in the statistical process. These  variables were categorized into 12 data groups: age, ethnicity, marital  status, gender, region of origin, type of school, type of family,  income quintile, campus, mode of study, career, and level achieved.  Table 5   displays the results of the bivariate analysis with their  respective statistical tests, including Pearson’s Chi-square and  Fisher’s exact test. The hypothesis was based on testing the  association of each variable with the dependent variable Y. It is  worth noting that for significance values less than 0.05, the  hypothesis of each test is accepted, indicating a relationship between  the variables under study.  Table 5   shows that for significance values less than 0.005, there is  an inferred relationship between the categorized variable and the  dependent variable Y (dropout). Specifically, the variables age,

Núñez-Naranjo   10.3389/feduc.2024.1444534  Frontiers in   Education   02   frontiersin.org  the Dominican Republic and Bolivia, the rate exceeds 70%. In  contrast, Cuba has a dropout rate of 25% ( Mundial, 2017 ). The lack  of equity in higher education is reflected in economic inequality, as  students from lower-income quintiles are less likely to access higher  education ( Alvarado-Uribe et al., 2022 ;   Vadivel et al., 2023 ;   Wang  et al., 2022 ).  Ecuador also faces high university dropout rates, ranging between  12 and 30% in the early years of study, despite investments and  government policies implemented in recent years with a focus on  improving the quality of higher education ( Buenaño et al., 2024 ;  Núñez-Naranjo et al., 2021 ). Studies indicate more favorable terminal  efficiency rates in private university institutions ( Delogu et al., 2024 ).  Studies such as   Buenaño et al. (2024)   indicate that the factors leading  to school dropout in Ecuador are instructional and academic in  nature, with terminal efficiency rates being more favourable in private  universities. Therefore, in Ecuador, student retention is closely linked  to graduation, as if the retention rate in the early levels does not reach  50%,   the   percentage   will   decrease   by   the   time   the   program  is completed.  University   dropout   not   only   affects   families   but   also   the  government, as the resources invested are wasted, leading to increased  inequality, poverty, and limited progress in scientific and academic  development ( Humphrey, 2008 ). In this context, the purpose of this  study is based on the opportunity to provide updated information on  university dropout rates. Accordingly, a real case study is considered  within the social context of Ecuador.  University dropout is analyzed by considering temporal and  spatial factors. Regarding temporality, it can be classified into initial  or early dropout, early dropout, late dropout, and academic lag. Initial  or early dropout occurs when students are admitted but do not enroll.  Early dropout happens when students leave their studies after  completing the initial levels of their program. Late dropout occurs  when students leave after completing more than half of the program  ( Behr et al., 2020 ;   Gutierrez-Pachas et al., 2023 ;   Segura et al., 2022 ).  Dropout due to academic lag refers to situations where students  complete their program but do not obtain a degree due to curricular  requirements or graduation processes. From a spatial perspective,  university dropout addresses internal, institutional, and higher  education system factors. Internal dropout involves a student’s  decision to switch to another program within the same institution.  Institutional dropout occurs when a student leaves their current  university and resumes studies at another institution. Dropout from  the higher education system occurs when a student permanently  discontinues their academic pursuits ( Horstschräer and Sprietsma,  2015 ;   Salgado-Orellana et al., 2019 ;   Wild et al., 2023 ).  Given the above, this study analyzes the determinants of university  dropout in a private institution in the central region of Ecuador as a  particular case study, using both descriptive and predictive methods.  Historical data from students who began their first year in 2014 and  were followed through 2019 were used for this purpose. The categories  considered include academic, institutional, personal, economic, and  familial factors, with specific variables. The data were collected and  processed through data collection sheets and surveys. Therefore, the  study begins with the following questions: What are the determining  factors of dropout in higher education institutions? What are the most  impactful variables in this issue? How can school dropout in a higher  education   institution   be   predicted   according   to   relevant  determining factors?  2 Approaches and related works  University dropout is a polysemic term, and much depends on the  model used to study it, as well as the measures taken to reduce or  eliminate it. In this study, dropout is defined as the interruption of  continuous studies due to a permanent withdrawal, influenced either  positively or negatively. This withdrawal involves values and behaviors  associated   with   internal,   external,   and   circumstantial   factors,  including   personal,   socio-familial,   academic,   institutional,   and  economic   aspects.   Ultimately,   this   interruption   prevents   the  attainment of a professional degree. We analyze it from individual,  institutional, and state or national perspectives, leading to initial or  early dropout, early dropout, late dropout, and academic delay.  University dropout in Italy has been presented as a complex  process involving various factors and is explored through different  approaches and models, with key factors including family income,  grades achieved at the secondary level, and the type of school the  students come from   Delogu et al. (2024) . Similarly,   Martelo et al.  (2017)   highlight that, in the case study of the University of Cartagena  in Colombia, the factors driving dropout were the lack of study  outside the classroom, poor interpretation skills, economic problems,  and vocational guidance. In a specific case, the study conducted in  Ecuador at the Technical University of Ambato by   Ethington (1990)  found that between 2011 and 2017, the data collected showed a 39%  dropout rate in the engineering program, which was associated with  an academic factor, stemming from low performance in subjects such  as mathematics, physics, or chemistry. Finally,   Salgado-Orellana et al.  (2019)   used a model to predict dropout rates in the leveling course at  the National Polytechnic School, a public university in Ecuador. The  relevant finding was observed using a logistic regression model and  an artificial neural network model, utilizing four variables that  incorporated students’ academic and socioeconomic information.  Ultimately, the students at the highest risk of dropping out were those  in both economic and social vulnerability, in low-demand careers,  from   the   coastal   region,   enrolled   in   the   leveling   course   for  technical programs.  The Psychological Approach focuses on the analysis of students’  behaviors and conduct, distinguishing between those who complete  their studies and those who do not. A relevant model is proposed by  Fishbein and Ajzen in 1975 , which demonstrates that prior behaviors,  behavior, and subjective norms generate a behavioral intention to stay  or dropout. According to this model, university dropout is considered  the weakening of initial intentions, and retention is seen as the  strengthening of these intentions. In 1986, Atináis introduced the  concept of persistence and related it to the evaluation that students  make upon entering university. Ethington integrates these models  with Eccles’ 1983 theory and creates the achievement theory, focusing  on personality traits ( Ethington, 1990 ), and establishes that previous  academic performance is a decisive factor in current performance,  goals, purposes, and expectations, relating these elements to family  backgrounds. In this approach, personal variables are considered  attributes of the individual that influence both academic and  social integration.  The Sociological Approach emphasizes the attributes of the  university   student   and   the   institutional   environment,   without  considering academic variables such as grade point average as a  guarantee of retention or dropout. It is associated with Durkheim’s  suicide theory in 1952, which links dropout to problems of social

Núñez-Naranjo   10.3389/feduc.2024.1444534  Frontiers in   Education   03   frontiersin.org  integration, impact on interests, skills, dispositions, and attitudes. It  also relates individual variables, such as motivation, attitude, and  disposition for study, with social variables within the university  environment ( Spady, 1970 ). This model is known as the “suicide  theory,” where social-institutional interaction is crucial in deciding  whether to face academic and social demands, potentially increasing  dropout. Factors such as family and life situations also influence  individual integration into the university environment and can lead  to dropout.  The Economic Approach examines the cost–benefit relationship  of university education ( Wild et al., 2023 ). Students who choose to  stay in university perceive that the benefits outweigh the economic  costs and time invested, leading them to seek scholarships, tuition  discounts, and student loans ( Caire and Becker, 1967 ). This approach  is based on the theory of human capital, which holds that individuals  invest time and economic resources when they anticipate long-term  economic and social benefits. Dropout occurs when educational  investment yields lower income or unforeseen additional expenses  ( Cabrera et al., 1992 ;   Donoso and Schiefelbein, 2007 ;   Ishitani and  DesJardins, 2002 ).  The   Organizational   Approach   analyzes   dropout   from   the  perspective of institutional organization and the student experience  in relation to expectations. Aspects such as teaching quality,  infrastructure, class schedules, and extracurricular activities such as  sports, cultural events, and additional services like medical and dental  care are considered ( Bean and Eaton, 2001 ;   Bean, 1982 ). This model,  associated with Bean, integrates social, familial, academic, and  institutional variables and is based on productivity theory in a  workplace context. It states that dropout is related to external factors  affecting university students’ attitudes and decisions. The author  compares academic dissatisfaction with job dissatisfaction. Another  relevant model is Pascarella and Terenzini’s quality of effort, which  groups the causes of dropout into academic, psychosocial, and  institutional factors, including family backgrounds, institutional  characteristics, the university environment, and the quality of the  student’s effort ( Braxton et al., 2000 ;   Terenzini and Pascarella, 1980 ).  This model is considered interactive and organizational, as dropout  depends on the quality of the student’s effort to achieve their goals and  their interaction with the university environment.  The Interactionist Approach refers to dropout as a product of the  interaction between the institution and students (academic-personal).  The greater the student’s commitment to the institution, the higher the  probability of retention instead of dropout. Social integration occurs  in the classroom, fostering participation in learning communities.  This interaction results in benefits in terms of relationships, emotions,  or rewards of some kind. Economic, familial, cultural attributes, and  certain individual characteristics influence the decision to stay or leave  ( Braxton et al., 2000 ). Tinto’s model, based on studies by Durkheim  and Spady, argues that students who associate with groups or have  friends in the university context are less likely to drop out and  compares dropout to suicide, differentiating the consequences of these  two situations ( Halpin, 1990 ). Tinto formulates a theoretical model  that explains the individual versus institutional process and the  interaction between them from a longitudinal perspective associated  with social, familial, and personal characteristics.  In related studies, various strategies have been proposed to  address university dropout, as described below. In a quantitative  study by   García Ochoa et al. (2021) , who conducted a categorical  analysis of 3,289 students, revealing a dropout rate of 25.3% in the  first level. It was suggested to implement economic policies to reduce  dropout by 7%, especially in relation to economic variables. In  another study by   Núñez-Hernández and Buele (2023) , who used  action research and administered surveys to 260 students. Economic  factors were associated with dropout, and it was concluded that poor  performance, insufficient time dedicated to studies, and economic  circumstances influenced dropout.   Nurmalitasari et   al. (2023)  employed   qualitative   and   quantitative   approaches   to   observe  students who dropped out of private universities in Central Java,  Indonesia. Findings indicated that personal economic factors,  academic satisfaction, academic performance, and family economic  situations were the most influential in dropout. Finally,   Gonzalez-  Nucamendi et   al. (2023)   employed quantitative variables using  clustering and classification methods. Key variables associated with  dropout were academic performance in the first semesters, entrance  exam scores, number of attended class hours, student age, scholarship  funding status, and English proficiency. In a predictive context,  Hernández-Jácquez and Montes-Ramos (2020)   established a model  to predict the risk of dropout in upper secondary school students in  Mexico. The independent variable, dropout risk, was assessed  through the School Dropout Questionnaire, while the predictor  variables were study habits, self-regulated learning, and learning  styles (as deemed appropriate by the institution). A model was  obtained that includes dimensions of study planning strategies and  note-taking strategies, related to study habits; and self-efficacy for  learning,   related   to   self-regulation,   explaining   37.0%   of   the  phenomenon. Similarly,   Pérez et al. (2018)   presented a Model for  predicting first-year student dropout at the Universidad Bernardo  O’Higgins. They consolidated a tripartite matrix with data associated  with the variables that emerged from the analysis of previous studies,  and then analyzed the relationship of each of the explanatory  variables of the study with the control variable of student dropout. A  bivariate analysis was applied that allowed identifying seventeen  variables significantly associated with student dropout and specifying  the dependency relationships with dropout. The multivariate model  predicted   86.4%   of   the   dropout   behavior,   indicating   seven  independent categorical variables that ultimately emerged as relevant  factors in the prediction model. These studies and proposals  underline the importance of addressing university dropout from  various perspectives and using multiple approaches to better  understand this complex issue.  The importance of studying university dropout lies in its  direct impact on the professional and personal development of  individuals. Those who abandon their studies may face greater  challenges in accessing job opportunities and improving their  quality of life. Additionally, it can have repercussions on the  socioeconomic level, posing challenges in terms of competitiveness  and sustainable development.  From the progress made so far, the variables for analyzing dropout  are based on socio-demographic factors such as gender, socioeconomic  status, age, employment status, technology and health, gender, marital  status, race, ethnicity, area, region, academic level, and family  responsibilities, parents’ economic income, and institutional factors.  In order to conduct a more comprehensive study, personal, academic,  familial, economic, and institutional variables were analyzed. The  guiding question of this study was: What are the main factors causing  university dropout? This sets the general objective of the study as

The specific relational analysis is presented according to the  percentage distribution of each independent variable against the  dependent   variable   Y,   as   shown   in   Table   6 .   The   collected  information reveals that the variables associated with a lower  percentage of school dropout are as follows: for the age variable,  students aged 19 to 20   years showed a dropout rate of 10%; for  ethnicity, mestizos reflected a 23.34% dropout rate; for marital  status, married individuals exhibited a 31.70% dropout rate.  Regarding gender, females had a dropout rate of 37.40%. For region  of origin, students from the Sierra region had a 36.70% dropout  rate, while students from private institutions showed a 31.80%  dropout rate.  In terms of family type, students from extended family structures  had a dropout rate of 26.50%, and according to income quintile,  those from the middle quintile had a 14.30% dropout rate.  Concerning the campus, students studying at the Extension/satellite  campus had a 15.10% dropout rate, and those in the semi-presential  study mode had a 22.63% dropout rate. For the career variable,  dropout rates were quite similar, with Architecture having the lowest  percentage at 45.00%. Finally, according to the level achieved or year  completed, the tenth year had the lowest dropout rate at 0.40%.  However, it is noteworthy that with a 52.90% dropout rate in the first  year,   which   decreases   year   after   year,   this   figure   appears  almost negligible.  4.5 Multivariate analysis of logistical  regression of student retention  Processing the data using the SPSS program, considering the  encoding of the managed independent variables, the Hossmer-  Lemeshow test is first developed which allows to obtain the  classification table, the information of which is appreciated in   Table 7 .  Table 7   makes it possible to interpret that 74.60% of the data has  been accepted and processed correctly, providing the variables of the  model equation with the values observed in   Table 8 .  The following is the explanation of the summary of the model  which highlights the probability of the same in the   Table 9 .  To measure the overall fit of the proposed model, the results of the  Hossmer-Lemeshow test are presented which must generate a  significance greater than 0.05.   Table 10   confirms this condition.  The value of significance was placed at 0.392 above the value of  0.05, which ensures that the model has a high level of reliability and  can be of great use in predicting the behavior of the variables under  study. The correctly adjusted classification table is presented below, as  shown in   Table 11 .  The value of 76.44% allows us to infer that in future events  applying the current model, there will be a 76.44% success rate in  predicting the behavior of the dependent variables. Therefore, this  model can be considered to have acceptable efficiency. In this regard,  the conditions to be verified are as follows:  Ho: Bi   =   0, then the variable Xi is not significant H1: Bi   ≠   0, then  the variable Xi is significant.  Finally, the variables (Xi) that should be present in the final model  equation are presented. The results show that statistically, the variables  region of origin and the career do not form part of the final model  equation according to the value of Bi, in addition to the significance  of each, as shown in   Table 12 .  Based on the results achieved, it can be   inferred that the  determinants for this study associated with university student dropout  are of a personal nature (age, marital status, gender, and ethnicity),  family-related (region of origin, type of school, and type of family),  economic   (income   quintile),   academic   (level   achieved),   and  institutional (campus and mode of study). The model in general shows  a special relationship in terms of dropout or permanence, that is, EXP  (B) of 0.87 indicates that (1–0.870) x 100   =   13%, which indicates that  a student between 17 and 19   years of age has a probability of dropping  out, while those between 20 and 58   years of age can drop out of  university with a probability of 87%.

(2023)   focused on private  institutions, similar to   García Ochoa et   al. (2021)   and   Núñez-  Hernández and Buele (2023) . Their findings emphasized that  economic, personal, academic satisfaction, academic performance,  and family economic status factors were the most influential in  attrition. Compared to this study, personal and socio-family factors  were more prominent in attrition. In addition,   Nurmalitasari et al.  (2023)   reported that 56% of their students did not enter higher  education immediately after high school, a value similar to this study,  which corresponded to 74%. Reference was also made to income  levels, as 53% of the study population had below-average income, as  did this study, which showed 72.4% with below-average income.  Furthermore, in   Nurmalitasari et al. (2023) , engineering students had  an attrition rate of 79%, while in this study, engineering majors had an  attrition rate of 29.1%.  Gonzalez-Nucamendi et al. (2023) , analyzed a significantly larger  population, and the reported attrition rate was 8.5%. This value is  much lower than that observed in this study, despite the fact that both  institutions are private and located in developing countries, which  could be considered atypical.   Gonzalez-Nucamendi et al. (2023)   used  quantitative   variables   and   ranking   methods,   highlighting   that  academic performance during the first weeks of the first semester,  entrance exam scores, number of class hours taken, student age,  scholarship funding status, and English proficiency were the main  variables associated with attrition.  In relation to   Hernández-Jácquez and Montes-Ramos (2020)  together with   Pérez et al. (2018)   who used the principles of predictive  and inferential statistics to address the determinants of dropout or  dropout at the university level. Their contributions show the  importance of knowing the behavior of the independent variables of  an economic, social, academic, personal and cultural nature to  establish a relationship with the dependent variable dropout or  permanence within the course of a university career. In this sense, the  multivariate analysis, using the theory of the Multilevel Logistic  Regression model.  In comparison with previous studies conducted in Ecuador by  Buenaño et al. (14), their results are not fully aligned with the findings  of this study, as they only highlighted institutional and academic  factors. However, they do agree that retention or non-dropout can  be associated with the type of private institution of origin. On the  other hand, Mena et al. (22) determined that academic factors were  the primary cause of dropout in the Faculty of Engineering at the  Technical University of Ambato, while Sandoval-Palis et al. (23)  highlighted student dropout related to factors associated with both  economic and social vulnerability of the students, which corresponds  with the findings of the present study.  5.1 Principio del formulario  This work identified significant differences in several factors that  influence college dropout, including institutional, personal, socio-  familial and academic factors. These findings highlighted that dropout  and graduation is a function of the behavior of explanatory variables  such as campus, modality, age, gender, region, type of school, type of  family, socioeconomic quintile, and level of study. Retention and  graduation policies and actions should take these factors into account  to improve graduation rates and reduce dropout. Finally, it is  important to mention that this study had an important limitation in  that it relied on a purely quantitative methodology. Therefore, future  work could consider mixed approaches to analyze the reasons for  college dropout from a broader perspective.  Similarly, future researchers are encouraged to address this issue  from a longitudinal perspective, delving deeper through qualitative or  mixed methods approaches, including in-depth literature reviews or  systematic reviews with meta-analyses. This will help to highlight the  contributions of various authors and encourage the international  scientific community to tackle this truly concerning problem that can  impact the normal development of educational plans in both public  and private higher education institutions. It is also suggested that these  institutions review and update their comprehensive student support  policies, extending beyond an academic perspective. The goal is to  TABLE 7   Classification.

Therefore,   future   work   could   consider   mixed-method  approaches to predict the reasons for university dropout from a  broader perspective.  6 Conclusion  This study highlights significant differences in various factors  influencing school dropout. Through the initial study and descriptive  statistical analysis, it was found that early dropout before enrollment  among 65 students was primarily associated with personal, economic,  and family factors, with most being over 30   years old.  In the post-admission study of the group consisting of 419  students, the prominent factors were personal, categorized by marital  status (divorced), gender (male), and ethnicity (Montubio). Economic  factors were the second most significant, categorized by low-income  quintiles. Family factors ranked third, categorized by coastal origin  region, public school type, and reconstructed family type.  Institutionally, it was observed that the Extension site has a lower  dropout rate and a higher graduation rate compared to the Main  Campus. Regarding the mode of study, face-to-face education shows  a higher graduation rate, while blended learning experiences a higher  dropout rate. Concerning personal factors, the age at which students  enter higher education influences dropout, with those entering  immediately (ages 17 to 20) showing greater retention.  Gender is also a relevant variable; despite higher enrollment of  male students, they exhibit a higher dropout rate and lower graduation  rate. Conversely, female students show a lower dropout rate. These  results underscore the need for specific policies and strategies to  address these differences in institutional, personal, social, and  academic factors. Additionally, it is imperative to suggest that future  research using quantitative or mixed methods could provide a deeper  understanding of university dropout.  Given the study results, it can be noted that dropout in the case  study is marked by personal, family, and economic factors, with high  dropout rates in the early cycles of the degree possibly associated with  prior inadequate education of students from public institutions,  mainly located in coastal areas, which may represent a current gap for  future specific studies.  Finally, it can be suggested that by using the principles of the  Multilevel Logistic Regression model, universities could periodically  analyze dropout behavior and thereby establish strategies to better  integrate students into the university environment.

Núñez-Naranjo   10.3389/feduc.2024.1444534  Frontiers in   Education   10   frontiersin.org  5 Discussion  In the first phase of this work, a categorical analysis of attrition is  carried out using data from university students during a 5-year study  period. Subsequently, a comparison is made with other research to  identify the most significant findings. It was found that the population in  this study, although substantial in size, was smaller than that of other  research, such as   García Ochoa et al. (2021) , which focused on the  economic factor of students and reported a first-level dropout rate of  25.3%. This is comparable to the first level dropout rate of this study,  which reached 23.7%. It should be   noted that both studies were  conducted in private institutions and shared a quantitative approach and  a categorical analysis.  In the study by   Núñez-Hernández and Buele (2023) , although their  representative sample was smaller than that of this study, the authors  analyzed sociodemographic and technological variables specific to  distance education, using information from students enrolled in the  second, fourth and seventh levels. This study also highlighted the  economic factor as the main driver of attrition. There were similarities  with the current study, such as the fact that the majority of students were  from public secondary institutions. However,   Núñez-Hernández and  Buele (2023)   reported a dropout rate of 60%, in contrast to the results of  this study and   García Ochoa et al. (2021) , where the dropout rate was  lower. In addition,   Núñez-Hernández and Buele (2023)   mentioned that  no student over 40  years of age dropped out, whereas in this study, ages  20–58  years showed a dropout rate of 49%.
