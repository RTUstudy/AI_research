A lack of self-care, anxiety, poor attention, sleep disturbances, and a loss of interest in every- day experiences are some of the symptoms of depres- sion [2]. Depression has a multifactorial etiology, with genetic and environmental factors contributing. For example, people with first-degree relatives with depres- sion are three times more likely to develop depression than the general population. Several factors have been linked with depression. Hav- ing a depressed parent, particularly a depressed mother, is a strong risk factor for depression. A stable relation across countries is that women, beginning from ado- lescence, have a 2:1 greater probability of getting major depressive disorder than men. Moreover, for men, child- hood sexual abuse, conduct disorders, substance misuse, and stressful experiences with financial, professional, or legal significance were all strong predictors of depres- sion. However, in women, divorce, low parental warmth, low marital satisfaction, and low social support were all found to be stronger predictors of depression [3]. In a cross-national analysis based on surveys of 156,331 respondents from 29 countries, the lifetime prevalence of any mood disorder was found to be 9.5% for males and 15.4% for females. Notably, major depressive disor- der typically has its first onset during childhood through early adulthood [4]. Depression and other mental dis- orders are linked to significantly diminished life oppor- tunities, affecting both physical health and success [5]. The Saudi National Mental Health Survey, a face-to-face epidemiological survey conducted in a nationally repre- sentative sample of 4,004, revealed a 9.3% prevalence of mood disorders, with 6% attributed to major depressive disorder and 3.3% to bipolar disorder. Lifetime mental disorders in Saudi Arabia are highly prevalent and typi- cally have early ages of onset [6]. Additionally, a national screening conducted via phone interviews with 6,015 participants found that 12.7% of respondents were at risk of major depressive disorder [7]. Depression is a widespread mental disorder among college students [2, 8, 9]. A systematic review involving twenty-four studies reporting on the depression preva- lence rate among university students has found that the average depression prevalence is 30.6%. This is a greater rate than the 9% observed in the United States’s (US) population rates [2]. At a Saudi university, it was found that 24% of undergraduate students have a mood disor- der [10]. International university students (IUS) have also been the focus of previous investigations. For instance, a study conducted in Japan found that the prevalence of depression was higher among international students compared to domestic students (37.81% vs. 29.85%) [11]. Similarly, another study in Malaysia reported that the overall prevalence of depression among international stu- dents was 58.9% [12]. Many predisposing factors have been linked with uni- versity students’ depression. These factors include being a first-year student, living alone, being single rather than married, and having a low or high grade point average (GPA) [13]. Additionally, sleep and eating disturbances, family relationship alterations, financial stressors, and academic worries are all factors that might increase stu- dents’ vulnerability to depression [2]. In university students, depression has been associ- ated with lower academic performance [14], worse work performance [2], and increased dropout risk [15]. Fur- thermore, depression can result in a buildup of harmful consequences through adulthood because of its effect on social relationships and career prospects [2]. Our study investigated the prevalence and potential predictors of depression among Saudi students study- ing internationally, which to our knowledge has not been discussed in previous literature. There were limited stud- ies in Saudi Arabia that provided evidence about the issue of mental health among this group of population. Hence, the outcome of this study could be an important contribution to the literature, given the high prevalence of depression among university students in Saudi Arabia and the wide range of illnesses brought by depression if left untreated [2, 13]. We aim to highlight these factors and assess the prevalence of depression among Saudi IUS in the US, United Kingdom(UK), and Australia. Hope- fully, this research will draw attention to international students’ mental health and help acknowledge the factors associated with it.  Methodology  Design and participants  A   cross-sectional,   questionnaire-based   design   was adopted in this study, which was conducted in Febru- ary 2023. All Saudi students studying at a university or a college in the US, UK, or Australia for a bachelor’s, mas- ter’s, or doctorate degree were eligible to participate in the study. The three countries included in the study were chosen because they were Saudi students’ most preva- lent   scholarship   destinations.   Participants   who   were non-Saudi, not studying in the US, UK, or Australia, studying for a fellowship or a diploma, in their first year of college, or had not properly completed the form were excluded. First year students were excluded for two rea- sons. First, as they have not study abroad for a lengthy amount   of   time,   the   researchers   preferred   excluding them to reduce biases. Second, they would not be able to fill out items of the questionnaire like the GPA and yearly visits to Saudi Arabia. Participation was voluntary, and informed consent was obtained online before the survey.

Page 3 of 10 Alnaim   et al. BMC Public Health   (2024) 24:3101  Additionally, confidentiality was assured, questionnaires were submitted anonymously, and all participants could withdraw   from   completing   the   survey   at   any   time. This study was approved by the Deanship of Scientific Research at King Faisal University on February 1, 2023 (KFU-REC-2023-FEB-ETHICS525).  Sample size calculation  Four hundred and one participants were included in this study using convenient sampling technique. The sample size needed for the study was calculated to be 324 par- ticipants. Taking a 5% margin of error, a 95% confidence interval, a 30.6% expected population proportion, and a population size of 35,840 international Saudi students. The formula used is: where, The population size number was obtained in January 2023 from a governmental platform used by all Saudi IUS called “SAFEER2.” Which includes the number of all Saudi IUS in all countries. The expected population pro- portion was assumed according to a systematic review of depression prevalence among university students, which found that the average depression prevalence is 30.6% [2].  Data collection  Data was collected through an online Google Forms sur- vey from February 2023 to April 2023. Then, the survey was distributed on social media platforms and Saudi IUS WhatsApp groups. The data of all subjects were subse- quently stored in a secured Microsoft Excel spreadsheet file on Google Drive.  Study variables and instruments  The survey consisted of three sections administered in English. The first is for informed consent. The second section is the demographic data and risk factors section. The demographic part was designed to collect the general characteristics of Saudi IUS. Including sex, age, country of study, marital status, housing, academic discipline, sought academic degree, and number of years studying abroad. The risk factors’ part consists of the last GPA, personal and family history of mental illness, frequency of family contact, frequency of going out with friends, the yearly average number of visits to Saudi Arabia, having a financial aid program and feeling like a stranger. All GPAs are converted to a 5-point system and then grouped into five hierarchical categories.   The researchers have selected  n   =   N ∗   X /(X   +   N   −   1 ) ,  X   =   Z α/ 2   2   ∗   p   ∗   ( 1   −   p )/ MOE 2   ,  these risk factors after reviewing the literature and then consulted a psychiatrist to review them.   Only those who are getting their bachelor’s degree were asked about their GPAs. The last section is for depression screening. There are many screening tools developed from the patient health questionnaire (PHQ). The items in the PHQ-9 consist of the nine criteria for depression from the   Diag- nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition   (DSM-IV). However, we preferred using PHQ-8 rather than PHQ-9 for two reasons. First, the ninth item in the PHQ-9 is “Thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself in some way.” The authors of PHQ-9 (and PHQ-8) believe that excluding this item is appropriate if it will be self-administered which, in our study, it was. Second, The PHQ-8 and PHQ-9 were both validated previously, have similar sensitivity, specific- ity, and positive predictive value and have a similar like- lihood of predicting any depressive disorder. Thus, to screen for depression, we used the eight-item version of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) [16–18]. We used a PHQ-8 score of   ≥   10 as a cut-off point for defining clinically significant depression as it was suggested by the authors [18].  Statistical analysis  The data were analyzed using the software program Sta- tistical Packages for Software Sciences (SPSS) version 26 (Armonk, New York, IBM Corporation, USA). The numbers and percentages (%) were given for categorical variables. Univariate analysis was performed to identify the factors that influence major depression. Significant results were then placed in a multivariate regression model to determine the significant independent risk fac- tors for major depression. Values were considered signifi- cant with a p-value of less than 0.05.  Results  This study enrolled four hundred and one Saudi univer- sity students studying abroad. As described in Table 1, 52.4% were between 18 and 25 years of age. Male stu- dents constitute 53.9%, and 46.6% are currently enrolled in the USA. Most students were single (67.8%) and lived alone (30.7%). Engineering and technology disciplines were the most common specialties (48.4%). Over half (54.9%) were bachelor’s degree holders. Approximately 20% had 1 year of studying abroad. In addition, 62.3% had excellent GPAs (between 4.5 and 5 out of 5). Regarding the medical history of the students, 23.2% had a previous diagnosis of mental illness. Of them, only 10.8%   received   medical   treatment.   Family   history   of mental illness constitutes 17.5%. Regarding social status, approximately 37.9% of the students contacted their fam- ilies almost every day. 39.2% indicated going with friends

Figure 2 shows that 40.4% were deemed to have a major depression, and the rest were normal (59.6%). When   exploring   the   relationship   between   major depression   according   to   the   socio-demographic   and medical characteristics along with social status (Table 3), it was observed that students with major depression were more likely to be younger students ( p   =   0.038), in engi- neering   and   technology   disciplines   ( p   =   0.030),   never been married ( p   =   0.047), with previous diagnosis of a mental disorder ( p   <   0.001), with family history of mental illness ( p   <   0.001), having infrequent contact with fam- ily ( p   =   0.047), having infrequent going out with friends ( p   =   0.022) and feeling like a stranger most or all the time ( p   <   0.001). When conducting a multivariate regression analysis (Table 4), it was found that students who had previous diagnoses of mental illness were 2.89 times more likely to have major depression compared to students who did not have it (AOR   =   2.890; 95% CI   =   1.440 – 5.800;   p   =   0.003). Also, compared to students who never or rarely feel like strangers, students sometimes felt like strangers were at increased risk of having major depression by at least 7.06 times higher (AOR   =   7.058; 95% CI   =   3.219 – 15.476;  p   <   0.001) and increased by 5.07 times higher among those who felt like strangers most or all the time (AOR   =   5.069; 95% CI   =   2.558 – 10.044;   p   <   0.001). No significant effects were observed between major depression in terms of age, marital status, family history of mental illness, frequent contact with family, and going with friends after adjust- ment to a Multivariate regression model ( p   >   0.05).  Discussion  Depression   among   university   students   has   negative effects on their academic careers, including poorer aca- demic results, reduced productivity at work, and higher dropout rates. Moreover, depression’s impact extends into adulthood, impeding social interactions and pro- fessional opportunities, and establishing a detrimental cycle of adverse outcomes [2, 14, 15]. Many papers have assessed the prevalence of depression among university students, especially among medical students [2, 8, 9, 13]. However, to our knowledge, none have measured it among Saudi IUS. Furthermore, none has taken into con- sideration the factors associated with depression among the said population. The results of this study revealed that out of 401 Saudi IUS, 162 (40.4%) were detected to have major depression (PHQ-8 score   >   10). This is almost consistent with the study done in Bangladesh, with a prevalence of depres- sive symptoms in international students at 47.7% [19]. Consistent with these reports, in the UK [20], the rate of depression among international postgraduate students was 34.6%. In contrast, American international students recorded the lowest depression rate, as only 4.5% were positive for depression [21].  Fig.   1   Specific type of   mental illness

Page 6 of 10 Alnaim   et al. BMC Public Health   (2024) 24:3101  The results of our study offer insight into the higher rate of depression while studying abroad by considering the following contributing factors. Previous history of mental illness increased the likelihood of major depression by at least 2.89-fold higher. This finding is in accordance with a report documented by Amanvermez et al. (2023) [22]. They found that after adjustment for confounders such as socio-demographic data, depressive and anxiety symp- toms, and other sources of stress, international student status was positively associated with higher perceived stress, particularly in the dimensions of financial situa- tion and health of loved ones. However, in a paper pub- lished by Jamilah et   al. (2020) [19], socio-demographic characteristics such as age and marital status, as well as living condition satisfaction, problems with studies, food, homesickness, accommodation, and health were all pre- dicted to increase the risk of developing depression. In our study, major depression did not vary significantly by gender, country of study, living status, specialty, and aca- demic degree (p   >   0.05), which did not coincide with pre- vious reports. Feeling like a stranger increased the likelihood of developing   depression   in   both   "sometimes"   (AOR: 7.058) and "most or all time" (AOR: 5.069). Not oppos- ing this result, several studies documented that lan- guage barriers increase the likelihood of depression among international students [22–25]. Language bar- riers have always been an issue among foreigners, par- ticularly among first timers abroad who are used to speaking the native language. This contributed to the development   of   depression.   Hence,   linguistic   profi- ciency is an important contributor to coping strategies against depression [26]. Kabir et al. (2023) reported that international students who were suffering from financial constraints had a two- fold higher risk of suffering from depression. Other con- tributing factors were living alone and living with others [27]. This corroborates the findings of Jamilah et al. [19], with approximately one-third of cases complaining of financial difficulties and health problems. Hunley (2010) also observed that having a lower level of functioning was concomitant to an increase in psychological distress and loneliness [28]. In our study, living status and years study- ing abroad were not seen to influence the development of depression (p   >   0.05). the financial difficulties may have been mitigated for our study group by easier access to financial aid programs from the Saudi government and companies as 92.8% had financial aid programs. Motivating factors are indispensable to coping with mental issues abroad. Supporting this view, Hu et   al. (2022) asserted that effective coping strategies could link to better interaction with other cultures [26]. Sup- porting these reports, Zhao et al. (2021) noted that tak- ing preventive measures more seriously could reduce the depression rate of the students. Measures such as counseling and education programs are vital to support and enhance the mental health status of students living abroad [29]. In our study, communication with family  Fig.   2   Prevalence of   major depression according to   PHQ-8 (PHQ-8 score   >   10) among   international university students

These findings underscore the importance of social sup- port networks in mitigating the impact of stressors and promoting mental well-being. The influence of these factors implies that institutions should emphasize creat- ing supportive environments that encourage meaningful relationships and opportunities for social engagement among international students. Regarding the treatment of depression, medication or brief psychotherapy alone can relieve depressive symp- toms.   Nevertheless,   combination   therapy   has   been linked with markedly higher rates of depressive symp- tom relief, better treatment adherence, and improved quality of life [1]. It was found that while psychother- apy tends to increase frontal activity, pharmacotherapy reduces limbic structures’ overactivity [30]. Further- more, the inclusion of circadian rhythms normalization as a part of treatment for depression has been proposed [31, 32]. It was found that dysregulation of the circa- dian system increases susceptibility to depression [31]. Around 60% of depressed people do not seek medical help [1]. Many factors may hinder help-seeking. One is the stigma toward mental disorders and people who have them [1, 13]. Another factor is the lack of mental health literacy among the general public [13]. Explor- ing these strategies, along with those highlighted in this study, can provide valuable guidance for policymakers in identifying the most effective approaches to address- ing this issue. While   the   study   contributes   valuable   insights   into depression among Saudi students studying internation- ally, it is not without limitations. It suffers from sampling bias, focusing only on Saudi IUS in specific countries and thus limiting generalizability. Relying on voluntary self-reported data and exclusion criteria might lead to selection bias. The cross-sectional design makes it dif- ficult to draw causal conclusions and comprehend how depression levels change over time. The study’s focus on specific risk factors might overlook other vital elements like social support and cultural adjustment. The study only screened for depression without investigating the  Table   4   Multivariate regression analysis to determine significant independent risk factors of major depression   ( n = 401)  AOR – Adjusted Odds Ratio; CI – Confidence Interval **   Significant at   p   <   0.05 level  Factor   AOR   95% CI   P -value  Age group  • 18 – 25   years   Ref  •   >   25   years   0.671   0.290 – 1.553   0.351 Marital status  • Never been married   Ref  • Been married   0.787   0.350 – 1.771   0.562 Specialty  • Engineering and   technology disciplines   Ref  • Non-engineering and   technology disciplines   0.773   0.409 – 1.461   0.428 Diagnosed with   any mental illness  • No   Ref  • Yes   2.890   1.440 – 5.800   0.003 **  Family history of   mental illness  • No   Ref  • Yes   1.879   0.973 – 3.631   0.060 How often do   you contact your family?  • Nearly every day to   every day   Ref  • Every two weeks or   more   1.385   0.775 – 2.475   0.272 How often do   you go out   with   friends?  • Nearly every day to   every day   Ref  • Every two weeks or   more   1.361   0.665 – 2.784   0.399 Do you feel like   a   stranger?  • Never or   rarely   Ref  • Sometimes   7.058   3.219 – 15.476   <   0.001 **  • Most or   all the   time   5.069   2.558 – 10.044   <   0.001 **

Finally, the study’s temporal limitations might have missed seasonal fluc- tuations or long-term trends in the mental health of stu- dents studying abroad. For comprehensive and complex insights into depression among Saudi IUS, these con- straints must be addressed. The study’s findings carry significant implications for academic institutions, mental health professionals, and policymakers. Understanding the prevalence and deter- minants of depression among Saudi IUS can guide the development of targeted interventions to enhance their mental well-being. Culturally Sensitive mental health resources, awareness campaigns, and peer support pro- grams can address the unique challenges faced by these students.  Conclusion and recommendations  There was a high prevalence of major depression among Saudi university students studying abroad. Students who felt like strangers and had a previous diagnosis of men- tal disorder were more likely to develop major depression than any other university students. However, those with more frequent communication with families and friends were less likely to have depression. The study emphasizes the need for tailored mental health support for Saudi stu- dents abroad, focusing on social connections and acces- sible mental health services. Diplomatic headquarters abroad should take necessary actions to help their citi- zens who are experiencing mental breakdown. To further enhance our understanding and develop comprehensive intervention strategies, it is important to diversify par- ticipant samples, employ mixed methods, conduct longi- tudinal studies, include clinical assessments for accurate diagnoses, broaden the focus to encompass social and cultural factors, analyze data over different timeframes, promote international collaborations, advocate for sup- portive   policies   within   institutions,   and   expand   the research focus to include depression among Saudi IUS. Implementing   these   measures   will   deepen   research insights and guide the development of culturally sensitive support systems.

BMC Public Health  Depression among Saudi international university students and its associated risk factors  Mohammed   Abdullah   Alnaim 1* , Abdullah   Hamdan   Alghamdi 1 , Mohammed   Rashid   Aljawair 1 , Faisal   Abdulaziz   Alhadi 1 , Abdullah   Mohammed   Alomair 1   and Ali   Alsaad 1  Abstract  Introduction   Depression disorders are one of   the   most widespread mental disorders among   college students. In university students, depression has   been associated with   lower academic performance, worse work perfor- mance, and   increased dropout risk. his study aims to   assess the   prevalence of   depression and   highlight risk factors among   Saudi international university students (IUS) in   the   United States (US), the   United Kingdom (UK), and   Australia.  Subject and methods   This cross-sectional study was   conducted among   Saudi students who chose to   study abroad. A   self-administered online questionnaire was   sent to   the   students using an   online survey. The questionnaire includes socio-demographic data (e.g., age, gender, specialty, etc.), medical characteristics, social status, and   the   Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) to   assess the   student’s depression.  Results   Of the   401 students, 52.4% were younger (age 18 – 25   years), and   more than   half were males (53.9%). Most of   the   participants were studying in   the   US (46.6%), followed by   the   UK (40.6%) and   Australia (12.7%). The rate of   major depression among   Saudi students studying abroad   was   40.4%. In univariate analysis, major depression was   influenced by   age, marital status, specialty, personal and   family history of   mental illness, contact with   family and   friends, and   feel- ing like   a   stranger. However, after   conducting multivariate regression analysis, previous diagnoses of   mental illness and   feeling a   stranger were identified as   the   significant independent risk factors for   major depression.  Conclusion   This study provides insights into   the   prevalence and   risk factors associated with   depression among   Saudi IUS. The prevalence of   major depression among   Saudi IUS was   40.4%. Previous history of   mental illness and   feeling like   strangers were identified as   the   most prominent risk factors in   this study. Identifying the   prevalence and   contrib- uting factors of   depression can guide academic institutions and   governments in   the   development of   effective inter- ventions and   support for   IUS’s mental well-being. Future research could diversify the   sample and   employ longitudinal designs.

It is commonly characterized by sadness, emptiness, irritable mood, and cognitive and somatic alterations that impact the individual’s   capacity   for   everyday   performance   [1]. Moreover, depression is a multi-faceted disorder that  *Correspondence: Mohammed   Abdullah   Alnaim 219033242@student.kfu.edu.sa 1   Collage of   Medicine, King Faisal University, Al - Ahsa, Saudi Arabia
