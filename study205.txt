teachers concerning learning strategies, and feedback from teachers. When exploring the dimensionality using Principal Component Analysis, we can see that the   fi rst composite measure explains 49% of the variance and the second 57% of the variance. Then, we controlled the two dimensions using multiple correspondence model   ( see Figure 1 ) . Based on the model summary, we decided to use the composite measures, even though the reliability statistics are below lower bound   ( see, e.g., Peterson, 1994 ) .  Ethical considerations:   The study underwent ethical reviews at the involved universities. The following long and proven tradition of intervention research in the education sector was followed. All the relevant national regulations, institu -  tional policies, in accordance the tenets of the Helsinki Declaration, have been followed. The study has been approved by the authors ’   institutional review board or equivalent committee at each university. The participating researchers did not process any sensitive personal data and the study in itself was not a major intervention in the participants ’   lives. The study was based on   voluntary participation   ( the participants were free to opt in or out of the study at any point in time ) ,   informed consent   ( partici -  pants knew the purpose, bene fi ts, and risks before they agree or decline to join ) , and   anonymity   ( the identities of the participants was not known and personally identi fi -  able data was not collected ) .  3 Results  In the personal dimension, Trautwein and Bosse   ( 2017 )  put forward balance of life; managing the workload and scheduling one ’ s own learning activities. When asked about their workload, 38%   ( 118/308 )   of the students agreed to a large extent having problems dealing with their time in a responsible and meaningful way. In addi -  tion, 84%   ( 258/308 )   answered that the time they spend on their studies had increased at university. There are, however, some di ff erences between the groups. About half of the Turkish students marked having problems managing their time, the ratio for the German and Swedish students was about one - third. Furthermore, a higher proportion of Turkish students   ( 91% )   and Swedish students   ( 83% )   noted that their workload had increased at university level. One - third of the German students agreed upon this. Table 3 shows the distribution of three content -  related aspects of managing the workload and sche -  duling one ’ s own learning activities. We then asked about the requirements of managing their university stu -  dies, 39%   ( 121/308 )   marked higher requirements than at upper secondary school, and 82%   ( 252/308 )   agreed upon a higher pace of study at the university. Regarding the notion of higher pace, the groups di ff ered a lot. 94%  Table 2:   Factor load for items related to personal dimension and organizational dimension  Component 1   2   3  The pace of study at university is higher   0.75 The level of di ffi culty of the course content at university is higher   0.37   0.55 The teacher ’ s expectations of me as a student are higher at university   0.74 The time I spend on my studies has increased   0.81 The requirements of managing my studies are higher at university   0.78 The quality of lectures at university is higher   0.66 I receive better support from my teachers concerning learning strategies   0.82 I receive helpful feedback from my teachers   0.78 Extraction method: principal component analysis.

in socializing with other students, 70%   ( 72/102 )   of the Turkish students found easy to socialize, while only 35%   ( 60/168 )   of the Swedish students, respectively, and only 22%   ( 8/36 )   of the German students feel the same. Considering the collaboration in teams, only 19%  ( 32/168 )   of the Swedish students found di ffi cult to col -  laborate with other students. Similarly, 27%   ( 28/102 )   of the Turkish students   fi nd the collaboration di ffi cult. The exception here are the German students that answer in 53%   ( 19/36 )   strongly agree or agree to this question. Trying to   fi nd out how the students cope with the social climate, we asked about how they feel having di ff erent classmates on di ff erent courses and how well are they integrated in the student clubs. To the   fi rst question, the answers look similar in the three universities showing that many of the students are positive   ( 82%   ( 84/102 )   of the Turkish students, 72%   ( 26/36 )   of the German students, and 61%   ( 104/168 )   of the Swedish students )   for having dif -  ferent classmates in di ff erent courses. A big amount   ( 58%, 59/102 )   of the Turkish students are well integrated in the student clubs, while only 38%   ( 58/168 )   of the Swedish stu -  dents and 33%   ( 12/36 )   of the German students feel the same. When analyzing the results using the composite mea -  sures, we can see no signi fi cant correlation between  Support, feedback and quality of teaching   and students ’  expressed emotions regarding con fi dence, stress levels, or feelings of being overwhelmed or underchallenged. However, when it comes to   Coping, balancing and managing workload , we notice a correlation to the level of con fi dence  ( see Table 6 ) .

both feelings of being overwhelmed or underchallenged and feelings of being socially integrated or lonely. The results show that aspects of the personal dimension  ( e.g., coping, balancing and managing the workload )  relate with this triad. Furthermore, the results indicate a relation between aspects of the organizational dimension   ( e.g., support, feedback, and quality of teaching )   and feelings of being socially integrated or lonely. There is no signi fi cant mea -  sure conveying this. Still, many of the open - ended ques -  tions uncover potential connections between di ffi culties and requirements of transition assigned to personal, organizational, and social dimensions. However, di ff er -  ences and similarities can be observed across the dif -  ferent countries.  5 Discussion  Our analysis, in line with Trautwein and Bosse   ( 2017 ) , suggests that personal, organizational, and social dimen -  sions in fl uence secondary – tertiary transition beyond the purely cognitive aspects. Still, we cannot conclude which one is more crucial. Nevertheless, there seems to be a triad of con fi dence, overwhelmed/underchallenged, and level of socially integration that need more attention in future research and course development. The results can be understood in relation to the aca -  demic, social, and emotional shocks   ( Cheng et al., 2015 ) . That is, how the   fi rst - year mathematics are organized, and to what extent, the students are prepared for, or get support in, balancing areas of life, managing work -  load, etc. Entering the university is for the student a way of maturing and growing up. This internal process in the secondary – tertiary transition is hence to undergo a change from familiar to the unknown   ( Cheng et al., 2015 ) . Here, the students need to develop their abilities to navigate in a new educational setting and   “ becoming ”   a university student   ( cf. Gale & Parker ’ s, 2014 de fi nition of transition ) ; the students ’   self - perceptions and characteristics will change. Inevitably, this kind of transition activates aspects related to the triad of con fi dence, overwhelmed/under -  challenged, and level of socially integration as detected in this study. The transition is hence both connected to the cognitive aspects of studying   fi rst year engineering mathematics, as well as going beyond such aspects. It can be said that students ’   success not only depends on subject knowledge but also   “ the ability to have healthy interpersonal relationships o ff   and on campus ”   ( Kuh & Love, 2000 as it was quoted from Aypay et al., 2012, p. 93 ) . Our aim in this study was to   fi nd out which dimen -  sion ( s )   in fl uences the secondary – tertiary transition in mathematics for   fi rst year engineering students. By looking into the data and responses to open - ended questions, it can be said that the transition is in fl uenced by these dimensions  ( personal, organizational, and social ) . However, we cannot conclude if one is more important than the other since they are all interrelated. Even though we have done our best to compartmentalize the dimensions, it can be also seen from the students ’   quotes that these dimensions are all linked. The results show a moderate correlation between feelings of being overwhelmed and stress, which is expected. However, di ff erences and similarities can be observed across the di ff erent countries. For instance, on group level, the Turkish students are more relaxed, more motivated, and eager to study mathematics than their peers in Germany and Sweden. Even though Turkish students indicate  Socially integrated /lonely Feelings of stress /relaxedness Feelings of beeing overwhelmed/underchallenged Coping, balancing, managing Feelings of confidence Support, feedback, quality ( p   = .057 not sig.)

the challenges of studying Math in English, they also emphasized the supportive nature of the organization. Furthermore, the results imply a moderate correlation between feelings of being underchallenged and being relaxed. This result suggests that there is a group of students not coming to their full potential. This result is important to recognize; even though not completely unexpected, it still not universal acknowledged. The phenomenon is due to the fact that   fi rst year engineering students usually read in large students groups with a large spectrum of pre - knowledge and it is di ffi cult or better said unusual to implement student - centered teaching and learning in such courses. This type of courses was the courses included in our study. The essential work focusing on the causes for high dropout rates   ( e.g., Gómez -  Chacón et al., 2015; Heubeil, 2014; Nardi, 2008 )   might hinder course development aiming for supporting highly able students   ( see, e.g., Vinerean et al., 2021 ) .  5.1 Limitations  The data collection was during the COVID - 19 lock down. We know that the COVID - 19 has had an impact on all of students and teachers   ( Nilsberth, Liljekvist, Olin - Scheller, Samuelsson, & Hallquist, 2021; Teke - Lloyd, Türk, & Bengü, 2022 ) . We cannot overrule its importance regarding crucial parts in the transition problems, i.e., the shocks   ( academic, social, emotional )   addressed by the models depicted by Cheng et al.   ( 2015 ) . There were di ff erences in how the universities handled remote teaching. How the situation  ( COVID - 19 )   a ff ected the transition is not examined in this study.  6 Conclusions and Future Directions of Research  The study was done across di ff erent educational systems; it was valuable to work from a theoretical framework both regarding design and analysis to detect di ff erences and similarities across our di ff erent universities. This is pro -  mising for future work when making in - depth analysis of both the qualitative and quantitative data collected in di ff erent educational systems. The secondary – tertiary transition is in fl uenced by the personal, organizational, and social dimensions beyond the purely cognitive aspects. There seems to be a triad of feelings related to being con fi dent, overwhelmed or under -  challenged, and feelings regarding the level of being socially integrated that need more attention in future research and course development.

In this article, we address the secondary – tertiary transition problem in mathematics for engineering stu -  dents. Based on a questionnaire with focus beyond the purely cognitive aspects, a comparison of the transition problem at three European mid - sized universities is car -  ried out, to identify common challenges and di ffi culties, as well as di ff erences. The questionnaire concentrates on the four dimensions   ( personal, organizational, content related, and social )   and corresponding critical require -  ments for a successful transition described in Trautwein, C., & Bosse, E.

Keywords:   dropout rates, engineering education, mathe -  matics, secondary, tertiary transition  1 Introduction  High dropout rates in the   fi rst year of undergraduate study are an expression of the secondary – tertiary transi -  tion problem, which has received much international attention   ( e.g., Bergsten & Jablonka, 2015; Cheng et al., 2015; Gueudet, 2008 ) . Dropout rates are especially high in degree programs where mathematics courses are taught in the   fi rst year of study   ( Heubeil, 2014; Troelsen & Laursen, 2014 ) . In mathematics - related subjects compared to other  fi elds of study, the dropout rates have led research to often focus on transition on cognitive challenges resulting from the speci fi cs of the subject   ( Gómez - Chacón, Griese, Rösken - Winter, & Gónzalez - Guillén, 2015 ) . Often the inter -  vention to improve the transition problem is   “ running bridging courses, lowering the level of the mathematics taught, or reducing the examination standards in order to avoid massive failure. For di ff erent reasons these reac -  tions rarely proved to be e ff ective ”   ( Di Martino & Maracci, 2009, p. 401 ) . The cognitive challenges may be far to be solved. However, students ’   di ffi culties during the   fi rst - year of undergraduate study cannot be reduced to purely cognitive factors. According to Di Martino and Maracci   ( 2009, p. 402 )  “ researchers who are interested in human performance need to go beyond the purely cognitive. ”   Clark and Lovric  ( 2009 )   describe the transition as a rite of passage with three phases of separation, transition, and incorporation. They emphasize the culture shock when a person undergoes a range of strong emotions that in fl uence her/his actions and behavior. Gueudet   ( 2008 )   shows that in many theoretical works on secondary – tertiary transition perspectives as indi -  vidual, social or institutional are considered;   “ clari fi cation of the causes   [ of students ’   di ffi culties ]   plays a fundamental role in the building of appropriate didactical actions ”  ( p. 251 ) .

undergo change and pass from the familiar to the unknown ”  ( p. 1 ) . Gale and Parker   ( 2014 )   describe transition as   “ the ability to navigate change ”   ( p. 737 ) . Both de fi nitions empha -  size processes within the individual. Coertjens, Brahm, Trautwein, and Lindblom - Ylänne   ( 2017 )   extend this by considering external circumstances that lead to the internal process. All these de fi nitions outline change as a process individuals need to react upon. In this article, we follow Gale and Parker ’ s   ( 2014 )   understanding of transition as  “ becoming, ”   thus considering major challenges of the tran -  sition process and how it may result in changes in students ’  self - perceptions and characteristics.  1.1 Critical Requirements for a Successful Transition  Overall, numerous models have been used to describe transition and clarify transition issues. Cheng et al.   ( 2015 )  describes how all models address three di ff erent shocks  ( academic, social, emotional )   that mathematics students undergo when entering higher education. In their qualita -  tive study on critical requirements for a successful transition from student perspective, Trautwein and Bosse   ( 2017 )   describe four di ff erent dimensions,   Personal ,   Organizational ,   Content -  related , and   Social , that cover a range of needs students have to handle to make the secondary – tertiary transition. The four dimensions   fi nd their counterparts in the shocks  ( academic, social, emotional )   addressed by the models depicted by Cheng et al.   ( 2015 ) . Underlying the academic shock are the critical requirements from the organizational dimension   ( e.g., coping with the quality of teaching and supervision; dealing with assessment conditions )   and the content - related dimension   ( e.g., meeting curricular demands and pace of the courses ) . The critical requirements from the personal dimension are responsible for the emotional shock  ( e.g., balancing areas of life; managing the workload; coping with pressure to perform ) . The social shock   fi nds its counter -  part in the social dimension   ( e.g., building peer relationships; collaborating in teams or interacting with academic sta ff ) . In line with international studies, Heubeil   ( 2014 )   shows that dropout rates in mathematics and mathematics - related subjects are signi fi cantly higher than in other subjects. This has led to focus empirical research on transition problems in mathematics - related subjects mainly on the cognitive chal -  lenges and shocks arising from the nature of the discipline  ( e.g., Gómez - Chacón, Griese, Rösken - Winter, & Gónzalez -  Guillén, 2015 ) . The way of presenting mathematics at univer -  sity is in a dense, formal, and systematic structure known as  “ de fi nition - theorem - proof ”   ( Nardi, 2008 ) . Mathematical rigor increased abstract formalism instead of descriptiveness, and mathematical proof instead of performing calculations often poses problems to students   ( Gueudet, 2008 ) . These problems are all related to the content - related dimension and contribute to the transition problem. Even though various methods of teaching mathematics using new approaches were developed in the last years, there seem to be indications that not much happened after all in practice   ( e.g., Melhuish, Fukawa - Connelly, Dawkins, Woods, & Weber, 2022 ) . Moreover, even if the   “ student centered learning ”   is recognized as the   “ new paradigm, ”   it seems to be a lot left to be done when applying the methods in practice  ( e.g., Woods & Weber, 2020 ) . Students ’   fi rst encounters at the university level can be considered in respect of the di ff erences between the university and the school as educational institutions  ( Winsløw & Grønbæk, 2014 ) , that is, the organizational dimension. The design of the learning process and the quality of teaching and teaching styles di ff er from those in schools   ( Clark & Lovric, 2009 ) . This implies a need for students to become autonomous learners:   “ acquisition of a certain level of autonomy in learning is often seen by university teachers as the main stumbling block in the secondary tertiary passage ”   ( De Guzmàn et al., 1998, p. 751 ) . The strategies successfully applied to school mathematics often do not help for university studies where the teaching is more impersonal   ( e.g. Pampaka, Williams, & Hutcheson, 2012 )   and the supervision ratio is less favorable. As a result, students may not receive su ffi cient support from instructors when experiencing di ffi culties that are expected with the increased workload and academic standard   ( Trautwein & Bosse, 2017 ) . The transition to university is often accompanied by a move to a new city or to one ’ s own apartment. As a result, the social environment in which students are situ -  ated also changes. The cohort size and the class climate at university   ( e.g. constantly changing classmates )   di ff er from that at school, making it more di ffi cult to establish strong social ties. The social shock needs to be resolved in the entry phase of the study period so that students can  fi nd their place in the new social environment. In a study with mathematics students in Sweden, Stadler, Bengmark, Thunberg, and Winberg   ( 2013 )   found that as students pro -  gressed in their studies, they became less dependent on the teacher and increasingly built their knowledge with the help of other materials and especially their peers. In addition, social inclusion contributes to students ’   identity formation, stress management, and improved academic performance   ( Stadtfeld, Vörös, Elmer, Boda, & Raabe, 2019 ) . The above issues clearly show how important the social integration of students is for their academic success.  2      Mirela Vinerean   et al.

All of the above challenges have an impact on students ’  feelings and emotions. For this reason, some researchers  “ attempted to integrate both models   [ socio - institutional and psychological - individual ]   by using psychological fac -  tors, for example, to explain the integration of students into the academic and social environment of higher education ”  ( Hüther & Krücken, 2018, p. 187 ) . The change in the orga -  nization of learning and teaching style may cause students to become overwhelmed with the demands and the new required working attitude   ( Trautwein & Bosse, 2017 ) . The student – lecturer interactions are less personal comparing with upper secondary school and students can feel left alone and unsupported in the learning process. The lack of connectedness with peers further reinforces this tendency and can a ff ect student ’ s psychological and socio - emotional wellbeing   ( Hughes, 2016 ) . Already burdened by di ffi culties and failures, the unclear role of mathematics for the career path often hinders motivation and creates negative emo -  tions on students ’   side   ( Bergsten & Jablonka, 2015 ) , which ultimately promotes poor academic performance and high drop - out rates. The four dimensions   ( personal, organizational, con -  tent - related, and social )   proposed by Trautwein and Bosse  ( 2017 )   are thus also well founded from a theoretical perspec -  tive and are well suited as a starting point for empirical investigations. In the present study, we concentrate on the issues beyond the purely cognitive aspects. Based on a ques -  tionnaire, to identify common challenges and di ffi culties, as well as di ff erences, an international comparison of the tran -  sition problem at three European mid - sized universities is carried out. We ask: What dimension ( s )   beyond the purely cognitive aspects   in fl uences the secondary – tertiary transition in mathematics for   fi rst year engineering students?  2 Methods 2.1 Participants  In total, 499   fi rst year students from three European uni -  versities took part in the courses where the questionnaire was handed out. However, 191 students   ( 39% )   were excluded from the sample since they were not engineering students  ( e.g., prospective teachers )   or due to incomplete data. This left a   fi nal sample of 308 participants for the subsequent analyses. Participants were distributed across the di ff erent countries as follows: 36   ( 12% )   from Germany   ( DE ) , 170  ( 55% )   from Sweden   ( SE ) , and 102   ( 33% )   from Turkiye   ( TR ) . Sixty - six percent of participants were male   ( M ) , 33% were female   ( F ) , and 1% did not indicate their gender. Most students took the course during their   fi rst semester, but 40 of the Turkish students took the course during their second semester and 3 students from Germany took it during their second or third semester. The German university is an institution located in the south of Bavaria. The engineering program o ff ered is mainly computer science. The second university is a Swedish university o ff ering a large spectrum of engi -  neering programs on Bachelor/Master level. The third university that is part of the study is an institution located in the Anatolian region of Turkiye. It has a strong engi -  neering program that consists of civil, industrial, computer, electric – electronic, and mechanical. In - depth mathematics courses are mandatory for the engineering students in the  fi rst semesters in all three universities. The institutions are consider mid - size universities in their speci fi c countries.  2.2 Instrument  A questionnaire with 16 items was designed to collect information about possible transition di ffi culties from upper secondary school to university. Participants received the survey electronically through their emails by invitation and were asked to   fi ll in the survey anonymously and voluntarily. The survey consists of four parts with three Likert - type questions for each part and four open - ended questions. We asked open - ended questions to be able to delve deep into the topic and give students an option of free - form answers. The data coding and analysis were car -  ried out using the Dedoose software and IBM SPSS Statistics 27. The analysis of the external non - responses showed no systematic patterns with respect to central background vari -  ables. The analysis of internal non - responses showed no pattern indicating threats to validity in the items used. In their qualitative study on critical requirements for a successful transition from student perspective, Trautwein and Bosse   ( 2017 )   discovered 32 critical requirements that can be classi fi ed into four di ff erent dimensions   ( see Table 1 ) . The requirements written   boldface   are carefully addressed in our questionnaire and the ones written in regular style are only partially addressed. The requirements written in   italics  are left out due to GDPR   ( the General Data Protection Regula -  tion )   rules or not applicable to our study.  2.3 Focus in this Study  In the present study, we focus on the part of the ques -  tionnaire   that   can   be   categorized   according   to   the  “ Literally I Grew Up ”      3

Page 4:
Trautwein and Bosse ’ s   ( 2017 )   personal, organizational, and social dimensions   ( see Table 1 )   and that are linked to the beyond cognitive aspects of the transition. The students were asked to assess the degree of   social inte -  gration ,   motivation ,   interest , i nspiration ,   eagerness ,   con -  fi dence ,   success , and   stress when making the transition from school to university . All these characteristics can be related to the   personal dimension   and its requirements. The students were also asked about   having problems dealing with their time in a responsible and meaningful way   and if   the time they spend on their studies has increased at university . Other items that can be related to the   personal dimension   and the speci fi c require -  ments include:   the pace of study at university compared with upper secondary school , and the   requirements of managing the studies . The questions that can be related to the   organiza -  tional dimension , and the speci fi c requirements pre -  sented above, are focused on   the level of support from teachers concerning learning strategies ,   the feedback the students get from their teachers ,   the level of the teachers ’  expectations ,   the quality of the lectures at university , and  the requirements of managing the studies . The questions related to   the social dimension   are focused on   the degree of easiness in socializing with other students ,   the degree of di ffi culty in collaborating with other students, the degree of wellbeing of students, having dif -  ferent classmates on di ff erent courses, and the degree of being well integrated in the student club s.  2.4 Analysis Procedure  The study is a mixed - method design, using a   “ sequential exploratory design ”   ( Robson & McCartan, 2017 ) , con -  taining di ff erent phases of data analyses. The open -  ended questions were analyzed using qualitative content analysis   ( e.g., Bryman, 2004 ) . A priori categories from Trautwein and Bosse   ( 2017 )   guided the qualitative con -  tent analysis. IBM SPSS Statistics 27 was used to analyze the data statistically. Since it is not possible to measure di ff erent aspects of the secondary – tertiary transition using one single item, two composite measures were constructed. First, we used factor analysis to extract relevant items related to per -  sonal dimension and organizational dimension respec -  tively. We theoretically analyzed the components, and based on our analysis, we decided to collapse compo -  nents 2 and 3   ( see Table 2 ) . In the next step of the ana -  lysis, we used the two composite measures to explore students ’   expressed emotions regarding critical di ffi cul -  ties and requirements of transition assigned to content -  related and social dimensions. In the   fi rst composite measure   “ Coping, balancing and managing workload , ”   the following   fi ve items were used: the pace of study, the level of di ffi culty, the teacher ’ s expectations, increasing time on studies, and require -  ments of managing studies. In the second composite mea -  sure   “ Support, feedback and quality of teaching , ”   three items were used: the quality of lectures, support from  Table 1:   Critical di ffi culties and requirements of transition assigned to dimensions   ( Trautwein & Bosse, 2017, p. 379 )  Personal   Organizational   Content related   Social Balance areas of life   Cope with the quality of teaching and supervision Meet curricular demands and pace Build peer relationships  Arranging for housing   Deal with assessment conditions   Clarify study choice and study interest  Collaborate in teams Schedule learning activities   Cope with the formal regulations   Modify initial expectations   Interact with academic sta ff  Find mode of learning   Deal with institutional resources and restrictions  Identify performance and assessment standards Cope with the social climate Manage the workload   Gain an overall orientation   Generate subject related career goals  Defend study choice  Cope with pressure to perform and exam nerves  Use information and support services  Adjust to scholarly mode  Handle personal and   fi nancial problems  Handle course o ff er   Acquire academic language pro fi ciency Follow the lecture   Manage course selection   Develop academic skills Cope with failure   Reconcile subject areas and courses  Assess one ’ s own performance and capacity  4      Mirela Vinerean   et al.

organizational dimensions in more depth. The analysis shows that students ’   struggle balancing the di ff erent areas of life, coping with the formal regulations and the quality of teaching. Several students point to the aspects of adulthood:   “ literally I grew up ”   writes one of the Turkish male   ( TRM )   students, and a Swedish female  ( SEF )   student express:   “ I feel that a little extra self - dis -  cipline is required, otherwise it only works if you put in the time required ” . The aspects of loneliness are under -  scored by some students, here an excerpt from a German male   ( DEM )   student: In the   fi rst semester, it is basically already a very big change from school to university for me. You have to invest a lot more time because you only know a few people who can help you or with whom you can review certain content. Overall, it is very di ffi cult for me to get started, especially in such demanding lectures like Lin Alg 1, because I am very much on my own. Students also highlight the importance of building peer relationships, as a male student from Sweden said,  “ haven ’ t really got any study group which is sad. Sits mostly alone in studies but it would be good to have someone to brainstorm ideas with. ”   Students mentioned the importance of collaborating in teams and having more space to interact with academic sta ff , as one Turkish student said,   “ It was more di ffi cult to ask questions to tea -  chers in upper secondary school. On the other hand, tea -  chers at university are insisting us to ask questions ”   ( TRF ) . On the contrary, a student from Sweden said   “ almost no contact with the teacher at all. Gets more boring and less motivating when you have no personal contact in my opi -  nion ”   ( SEM ) . When it comes to coping with social climate of uni -  versity, a Swedish student said,   “ At the university, there is a much larger community and even though Corona has been a ff ected so we cannot hang out with so many, you still get to know each other in a di ff erent way than in upper secondary school. ”   One female and one male Turkish students also highlight the opportunities that universities provide, respectively,   “ university has many more socializing options and di ff erent groups of people. It ’ s easier to   fi nd groups of friends ”   ( TRF )   and   “ we have more opportunities to socialize at the university. People are more social and mature ”   ( TRM ) . Another Turkish stu -  dent added their views from a di ff erent perspective,  “ there was a friendlier atmosphere in upper secondary school, but we cannot   fi nd this at university. At university it is more like a workplace. When you make a mistake, there is absolutely no return. ”  We also see students ’   struggling with how to handle the course o ff er. As one of the Turkish female students describe:   “ Our lessons are harder and we need more social life. It is very di ffi cult to have both a social life and academic life and I do not know how to manage it. ”   Also, students from Germany and Sweden outline similar experiences: The way you study is completely di ff erent from upper sec -  ondary school because I have much more personal responsi -  bility and there is no support to seek from the teachers now, as in the same way as upper secondary school   ( SEF ) . The biggest di ff erence between upper secondary school   ( or, Adult Education in my case ) , is that at university there is less time with lectures/reviews than at upper secondary school, and consequently less time with the teacher. Learning at the uni -  versity is more dependent on being able to study for knowledge in course literature and online, in upper secondary school you get, as I said above, much more oral teaching   ( SEF ) . It sucks not understanding things right away and then some -  times you have doubts about your own competence and intelli -  gence   ( DEM ) . One of the organizational aspects that di ff er between the universities is if the tutoring is held in the main language or not. In the Turkish university, the lectures are held in English: While English is already a di ffi cult language, trying to learn all these math terms can take time. Like in upper secondary school, at university our aim is not only to pass the class, but able to use what we have learned in professional life and for that, we must work harder. Unfortunately, it can be di ffi cult to know this and work accordingly   ( TRF ) . There are also many students that are pleased with the situation. They put forward both the quality of teaching:  “ We had a higher degree of quality in the lectures than in upper secondary school. Very good and well - planned lec -  tures ”   ( SEF ) , and some of them highlight the importance of good study environment:   “ Much nicer work environment from both teachers and other students. Nice study places at the university as well ”   ( SEM ) .  4 Summary  The results from the statistical analysis put together with the conclusions after analyzing the open - ended questions show how di ff erent aspects of the Trautwein and Bosse  ( 2017 )   dimensions seems to in fl uence the secondary –  tertiary transition in mathematics for   fi rst year engi -  neering students   beyond the purely cognitive aspects  ( see Figure 3 ) . Feelings of con fi dence correlate with  10      Mirela Vinerean   et al.

( 34/36 )   of the German students and 92%   ( 154/170 )   of the Swedish students marked higher pace, but only 41%  ( 64/102 )   the Turkish students agreed to a large degree upon this question. As expected, most students   ( 87%, 265/306 )   agreed or strongly agreed that the di ffi culty of the course content at university is higher than in upper secondary school. To examine how the students ’   cope with pressure to perform, their coping with failure, and assessing one ’ s own performance and capacity, the students were asked to assess the level of di ff erent emotions that they have observed in their transition from school to university. Figure 2 shows the results on group level, and di ff erent patterns are revealed. Many of the German students   ( 80%, 29/36 )   and Swedish students   ( 62%, 105/168 )   are feeling highly stressed com -  paring with the Turkish students   ( 16%, 17/102 ) . When looking to the level of success: 33%   ( 30/102 )   of the Turkish students feel high level of success compared with less than 3%   ( 1/36 )   in Germany and 5%   ( 9/168 )   in Sweden. However, the students from Sweden   ( 55%, 93/168 )   and Germany  ( 44%, 16/36 )   seem to be more looking forward for their stu -  dies than the Turkish ones   ( 19%, 20/102 ) . Similar results we  fi nd when asking about the motivation where only 25%   ( 26/ 102 )   of the Turkish students are highly motivated, compared with 50%   ( 18/36 )   of the German students and 64%   ( 109/168 )  of the Swedish students feeling motivated. Furthermore, when looking to the results concerning students ’   con fi dence, we   fi nd that only 20%   ( 21/102 )   of the Turkish students are feeling con fi dent, with a better percentage in the other two countries: 38%   ( 14/36 )   in Germany and 36%   ( 61/168 )   in Sweden. Similar di ff erences we can see when looking to the levels of interest and feeling inspired. The Turkish stu -  dents show lowest levels of interest   ( 15%, 16/102 )   and feeling inspired   ( 11%, 12/102 ) . The German and Swedish students show feelings that are more similar: interest   ( 83%, 30/36 versus 74%, 125/168 )   and feeling inspired   ( 44%, 16/36 versus 55%, 94/168 ) . When looking into the social integration, 23%  ( 24/102 )   of the Turkish students feel that they managed to integrate, compared with 33%   ( 12/36 )   German students and 39%   ( 67/168 )   Swedish students. In the organizational dimension, Trautwein and Bosse  ( 2017 )   put forward aspects such as students coping with the quality of teaching and the formal regulations, dealing with assessment conditions. Table 4 shows the distribu -  tion of answers on items related to this dimension. With slightly small di ff erences between countries, 45% of the students   ( 140/306 )   agreed that the teaching styles of instructors are more di ffi cult to handle at the university than previous school level. In the same time, 51% of them  ( 158/308 )   agreed that the quality of the lectures at univer -  sity is higher. No big di ff erences between the universities were noted. When asking about the support from teachers concerning learning strategies, we found similar situations in the three universities with a third part of the students feeling that they get such support; 32%   ( 99/308 )   of the them feel that they do not get such support. When asked if they received helpful feedback from their teachers, there were no big di ff erences and 39% of the students   ( 121/308 )  agreed that hey received helpful feedback from teachers. A large amount of the students 77%   ( 237/308 ) ( with slightly small di ff erences between countries )   perceived the tea -  chers ’   expectations to be higher compared to upper sec -  ondary school. In the social dimension, Trautwein and Bosse   ( 2017 )  focus on students ’   ability to build peer relationships. Table 5 shows the distribution of answers on items related to this dimension. When asked about the level of easiness  Table 3:   Distribution of answers regarding content - related aspects of managing the workload and scheduling one ’ s own learning activities:   requirements of managing university studies, pace, and di ffi culty of course content at university   [ Germany   ( DE ) , Sweden  ( SE ) , Turkiye   ( TR )]  Strongly agree or agree   Neither agree nor disagree Disagree or strongly disagree DE   SE   TR   DE   SE   TR   DE   SE   TR   Total  I   fi nd the requirements of managing my studies are higher at university. 17   62   42   15   66   37   4   40   23  Total   121   Total   118   Total   67   306  I   fi nd the pace of study at university higher.   34   154   64   2   11   21   0   5   17  Total   252   Total   34   Total   22   308  I   fi nd the di ffi culty of the course content at university higher. 32   142   91   3   21   6   1   5   5  Total   265   Total   30   Total   11   306  6      Mirela Vinerean   et al.

student is, s/he express higher level of handling expecta -  tions and managing the workload. Furthermore, the results indicate a correlation between expressed con fi dence and feelings regarding if one is socially integrated or lonely; the more con fi dent the more socially integrated, and the more uncertain/doubtful the lonelier. Note, we do not have data to show causality. Table 6 also shows a correlation between stress levels and feelings of being overwhelmed or underchallenged. The results show a moderate correlation between feelings of being overwhelmed and stress, which is expected. However, the results also imply a correlation between feelings of being underchallenged and being relaxed. This result suggests the existence of a group of stu -  dents that are not coming to their full potential, that is, if the mathematics taught is not challenging enough, the students may not make enough e ff ort to progress in their learning.  3.1 Results from Analysis of Open - Ended Questions  Looking into the responses to open - ended questions may be the bridge to understand the personal, social, and  Table 4:   Distribution of answers regarding items related to the organizational dimension   [ Germany   ( DE ) , Sweden   ( SE ) , Turkiye   ( TR )]  Strongly agree or agree   Neither agree nor disagree Disagree or strongly disagree DE   SE   TR   DE   SE   TR   DE   SE   TR   Total  The teaching styles of instructors more di ffi cult to handle at university 14   72   54   15   52   30   7   44   18  Total   140   Total   97   Total   69   306  Teachers provide better support on learning strategies 5   53   32   17   64   36   14   51   34  Total   90   Total   117   Total   99   306  Receive helpful feedback from teachers 17   62   42   15   66   37   4   40   23  Total   121   Total   118   Total   67   306  Teachers ’   expectations are higher at university 31   134   72   4   26   16   1   8   14  Total   237   Total   46   Total   23  The quality of lectures at university is higher 19   78   61   14   52   27   3   38   14  Total   158   Total   93   Total   55   306  Table 5:   Distribution of answers regarding items related to the social dimension   [ Germany   ( DE ) , Sweden   ( SE ) , Turkiye   ( TR )]  Strongly agree or agree   Neither agree nor disagree   Disagree or strongly disagree DE   SE   TR   DE   SE   TR   DE   SE   TR   Total  At university, I   fi nd it easier to socialize with other students. 8   60   72   11   59   21   17   49   11  Total   140   Total   91   Total   77   308  At university, I   fi nd it more di ffi cult to collaborate with other students. 19   32   28   6   47   38   11   89   36  Total   79   Total   91   Total   136   308  At university, I think it is good that one can have di ff erent classmates on di ff erent courses. 26   104   84   8   58   10   2   6   8  Total   214   Total   76   Total   306   308  At university, I am well integrated in the student clubs. 12   58   59   13   53   22   11   57   22  Total   129   Total   88   Total   90   308  8      Mirela Vinerean   et al.
