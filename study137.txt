The consequences of student burnout can be related to the student’s mental and physical health.  Burnout may affect the learning process, achieving professional skills, and future effectiveness while working with a  patient and, eventually, might lead to the decision to quit the job. This study aims to analyze the intensity of burnout  syndrome among undergraduate nursing students based on their year of study (1), establishing the impact of stress,  anxiety, insomnia, and selected sociodemographic variables on the level of burnout (2) and establishing a student  profile predestined to be affected by burnout (3).  Methods   A cross-sectional study was conducted among 841 bachelor’s degree nursing students from March 2022 to  June 2022. The Maslach Burnout Inventory, Athens Insomnia Scale, Modified Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale,  and Perceived Stress Scale were used.  Results   High levels of emotional exhaustion were found in 40.9% and depersonalization in 20.33%, while low  personal accomplishment was found in 16.88% of the students. Students of nursing in Year 2 presented the highest  levels of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization and achieved significantly higher scores on the Athens  Insomnia Scale. The determinants of burnout syndrome identified by the regression analysis were: sociodemographic  factors (age, gender, and financial resources), the factors connected with the studying environment (year of studies  and clinical and academic stressors), and emotional/mental/interpersonal factors (anxiety, depression, insomnia, and  intensity of stress related to life situations).  Conclusion   The academic community should be encouraged to create a more supportive environment for students,  which will ultimately prevent dropouts and increase the number of nursing professionals in the Polish healthcare  system. We recommended carrying out regular screening tests for burnout, insomnia, anxiety, stress, and depression  (e.g., once a year) among students. Depending on the results of the tests, implementation of interventions aiming  at reducing the negative outcomes of burnout syndrome and promoting well-being and adaptive management  mechanisms should be considered.

BMC Medical Education   (2025) 25:178  evoke tension and job stress resulting from various situ -  ations that students encounter in a clinical practice envi -  ronment. A lot of students, while serving their clinical  internships in an unknown environment, experience, so-  called, transition shock manifested by anxiety, fear, ner -  vousness, instability, low self-esteem in terms of duties  performed, lack of competence, theoretical knowledge,  and practical skills. Therefore, students affected by work  stress, who also displayed negative attitudes towards  theoretical and practical classes, may be susceptible to  burnout [ 54 ]. Individual attention should be devoted to  the study’s findings, which conclude that a student’s sat -  isfaction with their own accomplishments decreases with  age. The results by Gu et al., partly correspond with our  results as the authors claim that the younger the nursing  student is, the higher their levels of academic achieve -  ment [ 55 ]. It might stem from the fact that the younger  the student is, the more interested they are in learning  new subjects, and they display a greater willingness to  acquire new knowledge, greater motivation to meet new  friends, and a bigger desire to cooperate with them while  studying.  Factors related to the learning environment  This self-reported study showed that such factors as the  level of depersonalization, the intensity of anxiety, or  clinical and academic stressors differentiated the nursing  students by different years of studies. The students were,  however, similar in the depression, intensity of concern  about life situations within the last month, and personal  accomplishment subscales.  Some researchers of previous studies have found that  burnout syndrome develops at an early stage of nurs -  ing education and increases with each academic year  and clinical training [ 56 ,   57 ]. The self-reported study  presented that Year 2 is the most difficult for nurs -  ing students. It is based on the fact that both emotional  exhaustion   and   depersonalization   scores   were   high -  est among the students in Year 2. These examinees also  reported the lowest results on the intensity of the insom -  nia subscale and the highest for the level of anxiety. In  addition, the students of Year 2 achieved the highest  average values on the intensity of clinical and academic  stressors. It might be concluded that the correlation  between the level of burnout and the year of study cor -  relates with the results collected in the Brazilian research  showing that the highest percentage of nursing students  experiencing burnout was in Year 2 (37.5%) and Year 3  (33.3%) students – Year 2 and 3 were statistically and  significantly related to burnout syndrome [ 2 ]. On the  other hand, Chinese population research by Kong et al.  reported contrary findings – the highest level of burnout  was found in Years 1 and 2 in comparison to Years 3 and  4 [ 28 ]. It is important to mention, however, that both in  Brazil and China, nursing studies last 4 years, whereas  in Poland, they are only 3 years. This shorter period of  studying in Poland may be seriously connected with a  higher burden during the second year of studies. It may  also be further related to the fact that in Year 2, students  are more often introduced to complex and complicated  clinical situations in medical simulation centers (high  fidelity classes), during which they are forced to make  more individual and responsible decisions and take part  in a larger number of practical classes and internships  in various hospital environments compared to Year 1  (more situations evoking the transition shock mentioned  above). Students of Year 3 are, presumably, more expe -  rienced and self-confident about their knowledge and  skills, which results from the previous experience gained.  To confirm this thesis, it is necessary to conduct a sepa -  rate study that aims to examine, for instance, the general  sense of self-effectiveness, emotional self-control, per -  sonal competence, and the sense of coherence in relation  to the year of study and the experience gained during  clinical practice.  Emotional/psychological/interpersonal factors  Previous studies on personality traits showed that a pro -  active personality and a sense of self-effectiveness in  nursing students correlated negatively with occupational  burnout [ 28 ]. Emotional intelligence, together with emo -  tional and cognitive empathy, is directly related to per -  sonal accomplishment [ 29 ,   31 ]. The self-reported study  found that sleeping disorders, the level of anxiety, the  intensity of depression, and stress related to one’s life sit -  uation within the last month affected the aspects of burn -  out directly.  While analyzing sleeping disorders, it is worth men -  tioning that the average overall score on the AIS sub -  scale for the whole sample group was 9.14 (elevated  level), which indicates a risk for insomnia. What is more,  the degree of insomnia appeared to be a direct determi -  nant of emotional exhaustion. The greater the number  of sleeping disorders, the higher the level of emotional  exhaustion. According to the Polish research by Bodys-  Cupak et al., conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic,  sleeping disorders occurred in every third examinee, and  the likelihood of insomnia prevalence amounted to 23.4%  [ 58 ]. On the other hand, the results reported by Wang  showed that poor sleeping quality of the students had  a positive impact on the degree of burnout [ 59 ]. More -  over, Amaral demonstrated in their research, that 4.7% of  their student examinees experienced burnout syndromes  and, concurrently, 34.7% of all the respondents felt sleepy  during the day, and 58.7% reported a low quality of sleep  [ 36 ]. Consequently, the prevalence of excessive sleepi -  ness during the day increases the risk of high emotional  exhaustion and high depersonalization. All in all, sleeping

BMC Medical Education   (2025) 25:178  Background  Nursing students worldwide are exposed to   burnout  syndrome resulting from constant academic and clinical  stressors [ 1 – 5 ]. What is more, nursing students experi -  ence higher stress and burnout levels than students in  other health professions [ 6 ]. Student burnout is described  in the scientific literature as a process consisting of three  major features: emotional exhaustion, apathy, and incom -  petence. The first refers to the feeling of fatigue which is  connected with educational demands. Apathy applies to  cynicism and distancing to one’s education. The latest  is related to a lack of personal competence as a student  [ 7 ]. Consequences of student burnout can be related to  the student’s mental and physical health [ 8 ]. Burnout  may also affect the process of learning, achieving profes -  sional skills, and future effectiveness while working with  a patient and, eventually, might lead to the decision to  quit the job [ 9 – 11 ].  First-degree nursing studies can be very challenging  and stressful for a student due to the transition from  basic to higher education, the academic workload (exam -  inations and assignments), and the pressures associated  with gaining practical healthcare experience [ 12 ,   13 ].  In Poland, nurses and midwives are educated under the  Directive 2005/36/EC of The European Parliament And  Of The Council   [ 14 ]. First-degree studies last at least  three years, not fewer than 6 semesters. According to the  Ordinance of The Minister Of Science And Higher Educa -  tion   [ 15 ], the overall number of theoretical and practi -  cal training hours cannot fall below 4720, of which 2300  constitute practical classes and internships performed in  hospital wards in internal, geriatric, surgical, neurologi -  cal, psychiatric, intensive care, long term care, primary  health care, hospice, etc. The number of hours remains  the same for both full and part-time studies.  To ensure patient safety and high-quality care, nursing  students need to master theoretical knowledge and prac -  tical skills. Managing medications, administering CPR,  reading EKGs, starting intravenous lines, and organiz -  ing work effectively are some examples of these abilities  [ 16 – 19 ]. Nursing skills also include building relationships  with patients, dealing with ethical problems, and making  decisions that follow ethical principles. This is because  there is a positive correlation between being able to think  morally and making ethical decisions [ 18 ,   20 ,   21 ]. Even  though the health sector is dynamic and unpredictable,  nurses must be able to adapt and respond appropriately  to a range of situations, so students also need to learn  critical thinking skills [ 22 ]. All the factors mentioned  above might constitute strong stressors, which, depend -  ing on an individual’s predispositions, may affect one’s  quality of life to different degrees and, as a result, initiate  burnout syndrome [ 23 ,   24 ]. Previous studies showed that  student burnout is correlated with stress, anxiety, and  depression [ 25 ,   26 ].  The research results regarding the frequency of burn -  out symptom prevalences are inconclusive. According  to the meta-analysis by Gómez-Urquiza et al., (34 stud -  ies,   n   =   2744 nursing students), the prevalence of burnout  and its dimensions varied from 19 to 41% [ 27 ]. Vascon -  celos et al. showed that 20% of nursing students revealed  burnout symptoms, including 75% having a high level  of emotional exhaustion, 29% with a high level of dis -  belief, and 33% with a low level of accomplishment [ 2 ].  Brazilian studies showed that the prevalence of burnout  among subjects was 10.5% [ 4 ]. The frequency of burn -  out among Chinese students was 31.5% [ 28 ]. Lopes et al.  found that 6% of their students presented high burnout,  including 36.3% with high emotional exhaustion, 37.7%  with high depersonalization, and 28.2% with low levels  of personal accomplishment [ 29 ]. In turn, a systematic  review by Kong et al. reported the overall frequency of  burnout among nursing students at 23.0%, with the fre -  quency of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and  lowered personal accomplishment at levels of 47.1%,  32.25%, and 43.5%, respectively [ 23 ]. Factors affecting  nursing student burnout include: gender, marital status,  number of children, difficulties in relations with others,  year of study, satisfaction with study results, quality and  flexibility of learning, the personal characteristics of the  student, sleeping disorders, the sense of belonging to an  interdisciplinary team, and interactions with colleagues  in a clinical practice environment [ 28 ,   30 – 36 ].  In the scientific literature, we found research focused  on the phenomenon of occupational burnout among  nursing professionals; however, it is worth highlighting  that there is no current research referring to the phenom -  enon of burnout among nursing students in Poland [ 37 ,  38 ]. Meanwhile, according to the report Staffing Disaster  For Nurses And Midwives, issued by The Head Chamber  of Nurses and Midwives, Poland is affected by nursing  staff shortages [ 39 ]. The Head Chamber of Nurses and  Midwives recommends educating 20 thousand nursing  and midwifery students a year to achieve an average rate  of nurses at a level of 9.4 (OECD) in a 15-year period.  However, to maintain the current level of 5.2 per 1 thou -  sand inhabitants, no matter how low in comparison to  other European countries it seems to be, it is necessary  to increase the number of students from 5.6 thousand  today to 10 thousand a year. Between 2021 and 2022,  only 60% of the nursing graduates started their nursing  careers (the ratio of the number of nurses employed to  Keywords   Psychological burnout, Psychological stress, Nursing students, Anxiety, Depression

Page 3 of 14 Szwamel   et al.   BMC Medical Education   (2025) 25:178  those registered in 2022 amounted to 66.66% and in 2021  to 67.19%) [ 40 ]. Therefore, it can be concluded that nurs -  ing students complete their educational qualifications,  but some of them do not start their professional nurs -  ing careers. This phenomenon is even more alarming if  we consider the aging demographic process in European  societies, including in Poland, and the growing demand  for nursing services in coming years [ 41 ]. Furthermore,  the average age of a nurse in Poland is 54 years old.  According to the report we mentioned above, 30% of the  working nurses have already gained their pension rights,  and by 2030, 65% of the currently employed nurses will  have achieved one [ 40 ]. Taking all these facts into seri -  ous consideration, we can conclude that there is a strong  demand for new nurses and a significant need to take  good care of the present nursing students to ensure the  largest possible number of graduates will be introduced  into the healthcare system of Poland.  In light of the above, it is really interesting to know  what factors determine Polish nursing student burnout  and the level of the phenomenon for each aspect. The  results collected are expected to serve to adjust proper  burnout prevention programs. The study aimed to ana -  lyze the intensity of burnout syndrome among under -  graduate nursing students depending on the year of  study, establish the impact of stress, anxiety, insomnia,  and selected sociodemographic variables on the level  of burnout, and establish a student profile predestined  to be affected by burnout. We hypothesized that there  is a profile for students who are predisposed to emo -  tional exhaustion, depersonalization, and low personal  accomplishment.  Methods  Study design and setting  This was a cross-sectional study conducted from March  2022 to June 2022. The research was carried out in Pol -  ish   medical   higher   education   institutions,   educating  nursing students in their first-degree studies (Bachelor’s  degree). The study is part of a greater project aimed at  not only analyzing burnout determinants but also those  for stress and insomnia. This study presents only the  results achieved considering burnout. The Strengthening  the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology  (STROBE) guidelines were followed.  Data collection  The   study   was   conducted   among   Bachelor’s   degree  nursing   students   of   6   higher   education   institutions  from the voivodeships of Silesian, Opolskie, and Lubus -  kie   (Poland).   Education   institutions   were   purposively  selected for the research sample. To objectify the results  of the student selection process, the authors aimed to  select students from two universities, two state higher  vocational schools, and two private institutions. A non-  probability sampling method was applied to the students  (only volunteers were recruited). The inclusion criteria  included being an adult, a student of first-degree nurs -  ing studies of the institution invited to participate, and  a native speaker of Polish, capable of both speaking and  writing. The examinees who did not meet the criteria  above (including second-degree nursing students) were  excluded from the study.  The examination was carried out by the authors of the  study, being the educational institutions’ lecturers. Before  the examination, each student was informed about the  aim, method, and possibility of withdrawal at any stage  of the research. The examinees were also assured full  anonymity and informed of the voluntary nature of the  study. The students filled in the questionnaire personally  (paper-pen method). They received anonymous ques -  tionnaires with blank envelopes. After the students had  completed the questionnaires, they put them in the enve -  lopes, sealed them, and submitted them to the researcher.  Initially, 902 students accepted the invitation to the study  but only 866 questionnaires were submitted (the return  coefficient – 96%). Of the submitted questionnaires, 25 of  them were incorrectly filled in or lacked some important  data and were excluded from the study. Consequently,  841 questionnaires were used for the analysis.  Data sources/measurement  The research was conducted according to the diagnostic  survey method using the questionnaire technique. The  following testing tools were used:  Maslach   Burnout   Inventory   (MBI)   evaluates   three  aspects   of   burnout   syndrome:   emotional   exhaustion,  depersonalization or cynicism, and low (reduced) per -  sonal accomplishment [ 42 ]. It consists of 22 test ques -  tions. The answers are given according to the 7-point  scale of frequency where 0 means ‘never’ and 6 ‘every  day’. The score is calculated separately for each subscale  by adding the points in each aspect: emotional exhaus -  tion—high (>   27), moderate [ 17 – 26 ], and low (0–16);  depersonalization—high   (>   13),   moderate   [ 7 – 12 ],   and  low (0–6); personal accomplishment—high (0–31), mod -  erate [ 32 – 38 ], and low (>   39). The higher the scores on  the emotional exhaustion and depersonalization scales,  the more intense the burnout is, while the lower the score  on the sense of accomplishment scale, the higher the  indicator of burnout. The MBI questionnaire has been  used before to examine nursing student burnout [ 4 ,   29 ,  43 ]. To apply this tool for our research, it was necessary  to change some words with concurrent retention of their  meaning and sense. The changes included: ‘my work’,  which was replaced with ‘my practical classes and intern -  ships’. The number of subscale positions and the pattern  of result calculations maintained the same. The internal

Page 4:
Page 4 of 14 Szwamel   et al.   BMC Medical Education   (2025) 25:178  consistency   coefficients   calculated   for   our   research  sample were as follows: emotional exhaustion – 0.865,  depersonalization – 0.753, and personal accomplishment  – 0.779.  The   Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS)   provides a quantita -  tive measurement of insomnia symptoms [ 44 ]. The scale  consists of 8 closed-end questions with 4 possible answer  options. A score of 5 points indicates a normal level;  however, results from 6 to 10 points identify a deviation  from the norm (increased risk of insomnia). Finally, a  result above 11 points indicates insomnia. The internal  consistency coefficient calculated from our research sam -  ple was 0.839.  Modified   Hospital   Anxiety   and   Depression   Scale  (HADS-M)   is one of the most commonly used screening  methods for assessing the level of anxiety and depres -  sion. The scale consists of 16 closed-end questions with  4 possible answer options. Scores of 0–7 indicate normal  levels of anxiety and depression, 8–10 indicate borderline  abnormal anxiety and depression levels, and 11–21 indi -  cate high levels, suggesting the disease [ 45 ]. The internal  consistency   coefficients   calculated   from   our   research  sample were as follows: anxiety — 0.807, depression —  0.81, and aggression — 0.78.  The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10)   aims to assess the  intensity of stress related to one’s life situation within the  last month. It consists of 10 questions referring to subjec -  tive feelings connected with personal issues and events,  behaviors, and ways to deal with them. An examinee  evaluates each statement on a 4-degree scale (0 – ‘never’,  1 – ‘hardly ever’, 2 – ‘sometimes’, 3 – ‘quite often’, and 4  – ‘very often’). The overall result is the sum of all points  (from 0 to 40). The higher the result, the higher the inten -  sity of stress experienced [ 46 ]. The internal consistency  coefficient   calculated   from   our   research   sample   was  0.863.  The authors’ own questionnaire   consisted of two parts.  Part one collected sociodemographic data (7 questions).  Part two, entitled “Stressors related to academic and clin -  ical practice”, included 17 statements related to situations  that might be stressful for a student while contacting a  patient during practical classes or internships, as well as  others connected with difficulties, challenges, and issues  arising while learning theoretical subjects. The state -  ments were created and chosen by the authors (K.S. and  W.K.) based on the review of existing literature [ 47 – 49 ].  The statements chosen fell into two subscales: clinical  stressors (9 items) and academic stressors (8 items). The  examinee was supposed to evaluate each statement using  a 5–degree Likert Scale (1 – never, 2 – hardly ever, 3 –  sometimes, 4 – quite often, 5 – very often). The highest  possible score was 45 for the clinical subscale and 40 for  the academic subscale. The higher the score, the higher  the intensity of stressors. The α - Cronbach coefficient  for the tool was 0.856, whereas, individually, the clinical  stressors subscale – 0.789 and academic subscale – 0.799.  To sum up, it can be concluded that the tool itself and  both subscales are reliable.  Study size  Based on the data published by The Ministry of Health,  the   number   of   nursing   students   accepted   for   first-  degree studies was as follows: 6652 in 2018/2019, 7840  in 2019/2020, and 8202 in 2020/21; which amounts to  22,694 students for all three years. With a confidence  level of 95%, a margin of error of 5%, and a   p   =   50%, the  minimum study sample was set at 378 subjects. There -  fore, it must be stated that the number of students exam -  ined for the study (841) was sufficient.  Statistical methods  For quantitative variables - means, standard deviations,  medians, and quartiles were calculated. For qualitative  variables - the number and percentage of occurrences  of each value were counted. The comparison of qualita -  tive variables was performed with a chi-square test (with  Yate’s correction for Table   1   ×   1 ) or Fischer’s exact test  when low expected numbers appeared in the tables. The  normality of the distribution of variables was tested using  the Shapiro-Wilk test. In the case of non-compliance of  the distribution of the variables with a normal distri -  bution, non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney’s test or  Kruskal-Wallis test) were used. The comparison of quan -  titative variables between two groups was assessed with  the Mann-Whitney’s test and between three groups with  the Kruskal-Wallis test. After statistically significant dif -  ferences were found, Dunn’s post hoc test was used to  identify the groups that were statistically different.  One   or   multi-factorial   analysis   of   the   influence   of  many variables on the quantitative variable was con -  ducted using the linear regression method. The results  were presented in the form of the parameter values of the  regression model with 95% confidence intervals. Missing  and incomplete data were excluded from univariate and  multivariate models. The regression calculation included  all potential determinants (no selection was performed)  because of the high ratio of the observation number to  the number of variables (SPV,   subjects per variable ),  which amounted to 52. The significance level for the  study was assumed at the level of 0.05. Therefore, all  p-values below 0.05 were interpreted as showing signifi -  cant correlations. The analysis was performed with the  use of programme R, version 4.2.1.  Ethical considerations  Ethics approval was obtained from The Ethics Committee  at the Silesian University of Medicine in Katowice (No  02/KEBN/2022). The research was conducted according

Page 11 of 14 Szwamel   et al.   BMC Medical Education   (2025) 25:178  disorders were correlated with all aspects of burnout syn -  drome in this study.  The average point value for the intensity of depression  in the whole sample group of the self-reported study was  6.09   ±   4.06 points (normal level), for the anxiety sub -  scale,   it   was   9.00   ±   4.37   points   (borderline/abnormal  anxiety), and for the intensity of stress related to one’s life  situation, it was 20.20   ±   6.98 points (average level). The  examinees also reported average values for clinical and  academic stressor subscales – 23.50 and 26.29 points,  respectively – which amounts to an average intensity  for both stressors. However, the analysis of regression  proved that depression and clinical and academic stress -  ors constitute direct determinants of all aspects of burn -  out syndrome. This means that the higher the intensity  of depression and stressors, the higher the chance of  developing burnout among students. Moreover, anxiety  and a high level of stress related to one’s life situation  predestined students to experience emotional exhaus -  tion. In the research by Hwang et al., the nursing stu -  dents’ academic burnout was significantly and positively  correlated with stress ( r   =   0.52,   p   <   0.001) and depression  ( r   =   0.44,   p   <   0.001). Moreover, the authors confirmed that  in 44% of the examinees, without experience in clinical  practice,   anxiety   and   depression   influenced   burnout,  whereas stress and great satisfaction led to the phenom -  enon in 33% of those experienced in clinical practice [ 25 ].  Sonmez et al., who have conducted a longitudinal study,  showed that during nursing education, factors such as  prevalence of depression, intense anxiety, and psycho -  logical distress increased due to numerous stressful situ -  ations [ 60 ]. Stress and anxiety among students of nursing  might adversely affect learning motivation, the process  of learning itself, and academic results as well as clinical  practice, communication with patients, and engagement  in patient care. All these may give rise to the deteriora -  tion of nursing services served by a student [ 61 ]. Taking  this into consideration, maintaining mental well-being at  a high level in future healthcare workers should be a key  point of nursing education.  Strengths and limitations of the study  By identifying the determinants of the components of  burnout syndrome, this study is innovative in its attempts  to determine a student profile at risk of developing emo -  tional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a sense of low  personal accomplishment. The strength of our study is  the fact that it was conducted in several medical insti -  tutions in three voivodships. Examining students from  both   state   and   private   institutions   (universities   and  higher vocational schools) allows an increased objectiv -  ism of the results and constitutes another advantage. It  is worth, however, in the future, to carry out some more  research to determine whether there are any significant  differences between state and private students. Due to  the use of self-administered questionnaires, the study  might have suffered from social desirability bias. Yet, it  has to be noted that the questionnaires used for the study  were all standardized, and the one created by the authors  about clinical and academic stressors is characterized by  high reliability based on the α-Cronbach coefficient for  the whole test and its two subscales.  One of the limitations of the study is that we did not  use random selection for the research sample, only pur -  posive selection. We included volunteers in the sample,  which may have affected the representativeness of the  sample. What is more, both the historical data and recent  data show that the nursing workforce in Poland is mainly  women. Therefore, there were definitely more women  than men in our survey, which is another limitation of  our study [ 62 ,   63 ].  Certain   limitations   of   our   study   resulted   from   its  cross-sectional design. The inability to establish cause-  and-effect relationships is one of the most important lim -  itations. Our study does not provide information on the  temporal sequence of events, making it difficult to infer  the direction of associations. Furthermore, recall bias  may result from participants’ inaccurate recollections of  prior exposures. Cross-sectional studies may not ade -  quately account for confounding variables, which could  result in improper associations being discovered.  The above limitations must be carefully considered  when interpreting the results.  Conclusions  Second-year   undergraduate   nursing   students   demon -  strated the highest levels of emotional exhaustion and  depersonalization,   and   significantly   higher   scores   for  insomnia severity compared to the students of Years 1  and 3. It might result from high burdens created by theo -  retical knowledge in Year 2 and stress related to a huge  variability of health care centers or hospital wards where  they serve their internships and take part in practical  classes.  Emotional exhaustion is significantly associated with  younger ages of students (lower than 28 years), studying  in the second or third year, achieving a high score on the  insomnia scale (AIS), achieving a high score on the anxi -  ety and depression subscales (HADS), high intensity of  stress related to one’s life situation in the last month, and  high intensity of clinical and academic stressors.  Depersonalization   is   significantly   associated   with  male gender, high scores obtained by the student on the  depression subscale (HADS), and high levels of stress  generated by clinical and academic stressors.  Moreover, low personal accomplishment might more  likely affect female students, older rather than younger  students, students of Year 3 rather than Year 1, those with

BMC Medical Education   (2025) 25:178  Average values for burnout syndrome, anxiety, depression,  insomnia, and stress intensity considering different years  of studies  The research group displayed average values in such  aspects as emotional exhaustion (M   =   23.40; SD   =   11.21),  depersonalization   (M   =   7.24;   SD   =   6.04),   and   personal  accomplishment (M   =   30.29; SD   =   8.34).  The mean of the depersonalization subscale (MBI)  was significantly higher in Year 2 than in Year 1 students  (Year 2–8.00   ±   6.08 vs. Year 1–6.63   ±   5.66,   p   =   0.026). On  the emotional exhaustion subscale (MBI), the mean was  higher in Year 2 than in Year 3 students, while in Year  3, it was significantly higher than in Year 1 students  (Year 3–26.38   ±   10.19 vs. Year 2–24.38   ±   12.07 vs. Year 1  20.56   ±   10.67, p   ˂   0.001).  The students in Year 2, in comparison to those in  Year   1   and   3,   achieved   significantly   higher   values  ( p   =   0.008) on the intensity of insomnia subscale (Year  2–9.86   ±   4.62 points vs. Year 1–8.88   ±   4.43 points and  Year 3–8.73   ±   4.86 points). Moreover, the Year 2 students  had significantly higher values ( p   =   0.021) in levels of anx -  iety than those in Year 1 or 3 (Year 2–9.58   ±   4.22 points  vs. Year 1–8.83   ±   4.37 and Year 3–8.64   ±   4.48).  The mean value on the clinical stressors subscale was  higher in Year 2 students compared to Year 3, which was  significantly higher than in Year 1 (Year 2–24.94   ±   6.05 vs.  Year 3–23.66   ±   6.34 vs. Year 1–22.33   ±   5.98, p   ˂   0.001). The  results on the academic stressors subscale were also sig -  nificantly higher for Year 2 or 3 students than for Year 1  students (Year 2–27.72   ±   5.50 vs. Year 3–27.01   ±   6.34 vs.  Year 1–24.75   ±   5.96, p   ˂   0.001).  The examinees of all years were quite similar to each  other in terms of the intensity of stress related to their  life situation within the last month ( p   =   0.151), personal  accomplishment ( p   =   0.093), and the intensity of depres -  sion ( p   =   0.404) (Table   3 ).  Determinants of emotional exhaustion  The direct determinants of emotional exhaustion proved  to include variables such as age, Year 2 of studies, Year  3 of studies, difficulties in evaluation, whether finan -  cial resources meet one’s needs, the intensity of insom -  nia, the level of anxiety and depression, the intensity of  stress related to one’s life situation within last month,  and the aggravation of clinical and academic stressors.  The multi-factorial analysis revealed that every subse -  quent year of the student’s age lowered the score on the  emotional exhaustion subscale by approximately 0.088  points (regression parameter −   0.088). Year 2 increased  scores on the subscale by an average of 2.472 points  compared to Year 1 (regression parameter 2.472), while  Year 3 increased the value by approximately 1.996 points  in comparison to Year 1 (regression parameter 1.996).  Moreover,   the   doubts   in   the   evaluation   of   whether  financial resources meet one’s needs lowered the level of  emotional exhaustion on average by 1.559 points in situa -  tions where the evaluation of the statement was negative  (regression parameter −   1.559). Each point on the insom -  nia subscale increased the level of emotional exhaustion  by   approximately   0.273   points   (regression   parameter  0.273). Each point on the anxiety subscale aggravated the  score on average by 0.302 points (regression parameter  0.302). Each point on the depression subscale increased  the level by 0.344 points on average (regression param -  eter 0.344), and each point on the scale of stress related  to one’s life situation within the last month (PSS-10) ele -  vated the level of emotional exhaustion by approximately  0.16   points   (regression   parameter   0.16).   Each   point  on the clinical stressors subscale lifted the emotional  exhaustion score by 0.263 points on average (regression  parameter 0.263) and academic stressors by approxi -  mately 0.637 points (regression parameter 0.637, Table  4 ).  Determinants of depersonalization  The direct determinants of depersonalization were found  to be variables such as being female, difficulties in eval -  uating whether financial resources meet one’s needs,  the level of depression, and the intensity of clinical and  academic stressors. The multi-factorial analysis showed  that being female decreased the score on the deperson -  alization subscale by 2.105 points on average (regression  parameter −   2.105), while difficulties to evaluate whether  financial resources meet one’s needs by approximately  1.287 points compared to the opinion that they do not  (regression parameter −   1.287). Each point on the depres -  sion subscale lowered the score on the depersonaliza -  tion subscale by approximately 0.404 points (regression  parameter 0.404), while each point on the clinical stress -  ors subscale increased the score by 0.151 points on aver -  age (regression parameter 0.151) and on the academic  stressors subscale by approximately 0.161 points (regres -  sion parameter 0.161, Table   5 ).  Determinants of personal accomplishment  The   direct   determinants   of   low   (reduced)   personal  accomplishment included variables such as age, being  female, Year 3 of studies, the intensity of depression, and  clinical stressors. The multi-factorial analysis presented  that each increase in the year of age increased the score  on the personal accomplishment subscale by approxi -  mately 0.12 points (regression parameter 0.12), being  female by approximately 2.719 points compared to being  male (regression parameter 2.719), and Year 3 by 1.413  points on average when compared to Year 1 (regression  parameter 1.413). Each point on the depression sub -  scale decreased the score by approximately 0.459 points  (regression parameter −   0.459), while each point on the

Page 12 of 14 Szwamel   et al.   BMC Medical Education   (2025) 25:178  high scores obtained on the depression subscale (HADS),  and those who experience high stress due to clinical  stressors.  The results regarding the high psychological burden on  second-year nursing students in Poland and the factors  that predispose them to burnout should be shared among  academic nursing lecturers. This knowledge can encour -  age the academic community to create a more supportive  environment for students, ultimately preventing drop -  outs and increasing the number of nurses in the Polish  healthcare system. To address the negative trend of grad -  uates entering the nursing profession, policymakers in  Poland should consider extending the duration of under -  graduate studies from three to four years, as seen in other  countries. Alternatively, they could reduce the number  of theoretical and/or practical didactic hours during the  course of study. This could be beneficial in reducing stu -  dent workload and preventing burnout.  It is, therefore, recommended to carry out regular  screening tests for burnout, insomnia, and negative emo -  tions such as anxiety, stress, and depression (e.g., once a  year). Depending on the results of the tests it should be  considered to implement some interventions aiming at  reducing the negative outcomes of burnout syndrome  (the interventions promoting well-being and adaptive  management mechanisms).

Results  Participants  The sample group consisted of 841 nursing students,  including 739 women (87.87%) and 102 men (12.13%).  The average age of the examinees was 28.24   ±   8.6 (year  1–27.38   ±   8.42, year 2–28.65   ±   8.70, year 3–29.08   ±   8.67).  The   examinees   were   most   often   city   residents   (595,  70.75%). Most declared living with partners (465, 55.29%)  and working while studying (641, 76.22%). Students in  their 1st, 2nd, and 3rd year of studies did not differ sig -  nificantly in terms of sex ( p   =   0.196), place of residence  ( p   =   0.761), performing work during studies ( p   =   0.172),  and the opinion that their financial resources allow them  to meet their own needs ( p   =   0.114). The respondents dif -  fered statistically significantly in terms of marital status,  i.e., the higher the year of studies, the higher the percent -  age of students in a relationship ( p   =   0.014, Table   1 ).  Level of burnout syndrome in nursing students  Emotional exhaustion was high in 40.9% ( n   =   334) of the  examinees, while it was medium in 31.27% ( n   =   263),  and low in 27.82% ( n   =   234). Moreover, it was the high -  est among Year 2 students and the lowest among Year 1  students (p   ˂   0.001).  High depersonalization was found in 20.33% ( n   =   171)  of   the   students,   whereas   27.23%   ( n   =   229)   reported  medium levels, and more than half reported low levels  (52.44%,   n   =   441). Depersonalization was at a significantly  high level among Year 2 students and lowest in Year 1  students ( p   =   0.016).  The low personal accomplishment was reported by  16.88% ( n   =   142) of the respondents, while in 26.99%  ( n   =   227), it was medium, and in 56.12% ( n   =   472), it was  high (Table   2 ).

Page 9 of 14 Szwamel   et al.   BMC Medical Education   (2025) 25:178  indicated that this aspect constitutes the most important  factor evoking student burnout [ 1 ,   27 ]. It is worth men -  tioning that an emotionally exhausted student might  experience excessive tiredness, lack of energy to act,  and might not notice opportunities to regenerate them -  selves. He/she is characterized by a lack of joy in life  and increased irritation, impulsiveness, and inability to  develop relations with others. What is more, lack of per -  sonal accomplishment may be manifested by the sense of  low effectiveness in terms of effort put into learning, the  fall in the sense of one’s competencies as a nursing stu -  dent, experiencing difficulties meeting the requirements  set by lecturers and mentors, considering the whole pro -  cess of studying nursing as a stressful burden [ 50 ]. In  contrast, depersonalization is connected with negative  and distant reactions to other people, loss of idealism,  cynicism, and an indifferent attitude might lead to imper -  sonal attitudes towards others and even inhumanity [ 51 ].  Student burnout determining factors  This research also focused on analyzing the components  of   burnout   syndrome.   The   direct   determinants   were  identified by regression analysis and included sociode -  mographic factors (age, gender, and financial resources),  the factors connected with the study environment (year  of   studies   and   clinical   and   academic   stressors),   and  the   emotional/mental/interpersonal   factors   (anxiety,  depression, insomnia, and intensity of stress related to  life situation).  Sociodemographic factors  Existing research related to sociodemographic data cor -  relations with burnout syndrome is inconclusive [ 3 ,   33 ,  52 ]. The self-reported study shows that gender did not  affect the development of emotional exhaustion, but  appeared to be a direct determinant of the other two  burnout components. Being female decreased the deper -  sonalization scale score, and also increased the score on  the personal accomplishment subscale. It means that  men are more susceptible to depersonalization, whereas  women are more predestined to assess their personal  accomplishments as low.  The multi-factorial analysis conducted for this study  reported that every increased year of age lowered the  student’s score on the emotional exhaustion subscale and  increased the score on the personal accomplishments  subscale. This means that the older the student, the less  susceptible to emotional exhaustion he/she is, but unfor -  tunately, the less satisfied with their personal accomplish -  ments. The research by Manzano-García et al., revealed  that older participants had lower levels of burnout syn -  drome. This might be connected to gaining experience  with age [ 53 ]. It ought to be considered that younger  students   possess   less   professional   experience.

Discussion  This study aimed to analyze the degree of burnout syn -  drome depending on the year of study as well as deter -  mining the factors that influence the three aspects of  burnout, such as stress, anxiety, and insomnia and other  sociodemographic data. Eventually, the study’s goal was  to establish a profile of a student who might be predes -  tined for burnout syndrome.  The analysis of burnout syndrome aspects  The examined students achieved average scores in all  burnout domains. High levels of emotional exhaustion  were found in 40.9% and depersonalization in 20.33%,  while   low   personal   accomplishment   (>   39   points)   in  16.88% of the students. Comparing the results with a  recent meta-analysis by Gómez-Urquiza, Velando-Sori -  ano [ 27 ], it might be concluded that the results are quite  similar in the aspects of emotional exhaustion (40.90% vs.  41%) and depersonalization (20.33% vs. 25%).
