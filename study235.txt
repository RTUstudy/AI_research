Existing models that predict the intention to drop out require the incorporation of complex variables strongly related to student success, such as self-regulated learning. Moreover, new possible predictors have emerged in the context of a pandemic. This study set out to validate scales that measure the phases of self-regulation of learning in Chilean secondary school students and determine the association between self-regulation, forced labor   insertion,   technological   barrier,   and   intention   to   quit   during   COVID-19.   An instrumental design was carried out, where 251 students participated, and a cross- sectional predictive design with a sample of 171. Results showed adequate psychometric properties in assessment scales for self-regulation. Furthermore, the logistic regression model carried out to predict the dropout intention was signi fi cant. The   fi nal model showed that external causal attributions, planning self-evaluation, forced labor insertion, and technological barriers were signi fi cant predictors, achieving a success rate of 84.8%. In conclusion, although many factors are considered in dropout intention models, this study   incorporated   self-regulation   skills   that   can   be   promoted   in   students   and systematically   integrated   into   school   programs   to   help   reduce   dropout   rates   in secondary education, therefore contributing to a successful transition to higher education.  Keywords: intention to drop, self-regulation of learning, psychometric properties, secondary school, pandemic (COVID19) INTRODUCTION  Permanent school dropout before completing formal academic studies is a critical problem in the educational systems of many countries, both at the secondary and higher education levels (Cambron et al., 2017). The transition to university requires the deployment of personal competencies, such as self-regulation, in order to adapt and face the new academic demands (van Rooij et al., 2018; Lobos et al., 2021). Compared to secondary school activities, university activities are less continuous, schedules are more   fl exible, there is less external control, relationships between teachers and students  Edited by:  Adrian Castro-Lopez, University of Oviedo, Spain  Reviewed by:  Md.

to a load less than 0.40. The   fi ve con fi rmed scales and their respective items add up to a total of 48 items that assess factors related to self-regulation of learning. All the scales showed high loads in relation to the factor they belong to and were signi fi cant (see   Figure 1 ). Compared to the original scale, four items were eliminated since their factor loadings turned out to be less than 0.40. The   fi nal version of the scales is presented in   Tables 2 ,   3 .  Table 2   contains the Likert-format scales from one to seven points, while   Table 3   contains the Likert-format scales from 0 to 10 points.  Second objective results: association between variables  A logistic regression model was carried out to predict the probability of dropout intention. The predictor variables were sex,   score   average,   forced   labor   insertion,   technological barriers, willingness to study, self-ef fi cacy for willingness to study, execution/performance, external and internal causal attributions,   and   self-evaluation   of   study   planning   and learning. As is shown in   Table 4 , the model was signi fi cant   Χ 2      58.039,  p   <   0.001, so we can assume that the prediction improves compared to the null model. However,   some   variables   are   not   signi fi cant.   Each   non- signi fi cant   variable   was   eliminated   step   by   step.   The   fi nal model   resulting   from   the   prediction   of   dropout   intention included external causal attributions, self-evaluation of study planning   and   learning,   forced   labor   insertion,   and technological   barriers   as   predictors.   Table   5   shows   the coef fi cients of the logistic regression, the Wald test, and the odds ratio for each predictor. The odds ratio of forced labor insertion indicates that, keeping the other variables constant, students who are working are 6.8 times more likely to present the intention to abandon their studies. With a 0.5 threshold, the model predicts 83.0% of the cases correctly, but when we consider only those with forced dropout intention (yes), it was right in 19 of the 39 cases (48.7%) (in  Table 6 . For the confusion matrix (threshold at 0.45), we can observe that by adjusting the threshold to 0.45, the prediction of the model is improved to 84.8% of the cases correctly. By considering only the dropout intention (yes), 24 of the 39 cases (61.5%) improved. Graphically this is shown in   Figure 2 .

are more distant, academic demands are more complex, and there is greater heterogeneity among classmates (Sáez et al., 2018). Currently, researchers agree that the reasons for dropping out do not necessarily arise during the years of higher education. At this educational stage, the strategies deployed to prevent dropout could be late and are considered remedial. Therefore, it is a priority to understand   dropout   triggers   and   variables   that   in fl uence   this phenomenon   during   secondary   education,   in   order   to   deploy preventive strategies at this educational level (Csók et al., 2020). Dropout rates are considered a quality indicator among educational institutions, due to their high individual and social costs (Antúnez et al., 2016). Socially, it reduces the chance for economic success, considering that we are living in a so-called knowledge society. The possibilities for a country to   fl ourish economically are related to the educational   level   of   its   inhabitants.   Individually,   it   affects psychological and physical health in a negative way. As well, it is related to fewer job opportunities, lower wages, increased substance abuse, increased likelihood of having legal or family problems in the future, and higher chance to depend on social assistance or other public assistance programs throughout life (Adelman and Szekely, 2016; Gaxiola et al., 2019; Koc et al., 2020). The decision to drop out is preceded by the intention to leave. Dropout intention refers to all the thoughts related to the interruption of the permanence in the training cycle, which would lead otherwise to a completion degree (López-Angulo et al., 2021). Although some students drop out from high school without planning to return, in many cases students are involved in an ambivalent process that includes   periods   of   disengagement   and   reengagement.   Their intention to drop out is latent and is therefore a process. This process   opens   the   chance   to   prevent   their   permanent disengagement from the school system (Cambron et al., 2017). One of the main priorities of the United Nations Educational, Scienti fi c and Cultural Organization (UNESCO, 2017) is to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for everyone. COVID-19   has   generated   an   unprecedented   situation   in schools that puts this objective at risk. Students ’   permanence in   the   educational   system   has   been   negatively   affected   by technological barriers and forced labor insertion. Both factors are linked to socioeconomic conditions. The use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) has tried to minimize the risks of contagion, ensuring the continuity of the learning process. Nevertheless, this has led to the highlighting of social differences regarding the resources available for each family to meet   the   demands   of   synchronous   classes,   increasing exponentially the gaps between students (Tsolou et al., 2021). The forced labor insertion of adolescents has been an alternative to  fi nancially support their families (Arenas et al., 2020). Empirical research has shown that when secondary school students drop out without completing their training and obtaining a degree, the chance of accessing elementary occupations that involve the performance of simple and routine tasks and the use of hand tools increases (Mussida et al., 2019). Forced labor insertion and technological barriers are socioeconomic factors that exclude and marginalize students both socially and educationally. Therefore, they are considered triggers for the intention to leave school prematurely, greatly increasing school dropout rates during pandemic (Mussida et al., 2019; Auger et al., 2020). Although literature considers individual and environmental factors   in   dropout,   Tinto   (Tinto,   1975)   considered   studies abandonment as an individual failure in a certain educational performance. Accordingly with this individual approach, dropout has been associated with a dysfunctional self-regulation of learning (hereinafter SRL) in the student (Bernardo et al., 2019; Bäulke et al., 2021). This means that abandonment of studies is also driven by a lack of cognitive skills (de la Fuente-Arias 2017; Bäulke et al., 2021). SRL is a cognitive motivational learning system. It is based on a holistic view of the student development, including skills, knowledge, motivations, beliefs, and behaviors related to academic performance. The SRL includes different elements, such as planning an academic task, persistence in the face of frustrating results, and the adjustment of strategies to achieve success. Self-regulation approach represents autonomous, permanent, and effective ways of academic learning (Sáez-Delgado   et   al.,   2021).   The   classic   de fi nition   of   SRL (Zimmerman, 2000) includes self-generated thoughts, feelings, and actions that are planned and cyclically adapted by the student to achieve personal learning objectives in a three-phase mechanism: (a) disposition, consisting in relevant activities for task analysis, goal setting, and planning; (b) performance, meaning that the task is performed and completed with monitored performance progress; and (c) assessment, which includes results evaluation and re fl ection (Panadero, 2017). Researchers have suggested that SRL is related to high academic performance, enhancing the deployment of behaviors oriented to studies completion (Meyers et al., 2013; Cambron et al., 2017). Systematic (regular) cognitive work is critical for success, requiring self-regulatory processes that include study skills such as perseverance and various learning strategies (Meyers et al., 2013). Although there is plenty of theoretical and empirical evidence that supports the role of the SRL in academic performance success (Gaxiola et al., 2019; Romero   et   al.,   2019),   there   is   a   lack   of   empirical   evidence establishing associative links between self-regulation and dropout intention in secondary education. One of the possible explanations is the lack of valid and reliable instrument to assess self-regulation phases. A systematic review reported that available assessment instruments of this competence are validated mainly in Europe, having scarce evidence of validation in Latin America (López- Angulo   et   al.,   2020).   Also,   they   focus   on   the   motivational components of self-regulation, excluding the other dimensions of the construct. Two objectives where set for this research: 1) validate self-regulation phases scale in Chilean students of secondary education; 2) determine the association between self-regulation of learning, job placement, technological barriers, and intention to drop out in Chilean schoolchildren during COVID-19.  MATERIALS AND METHODS Design  This research was carried out under a quantitative approach in two   stages:   (1)   instrumental   design   and   (2)   cross-sectional predictive design.

Self-regulation of learning is considered a protective variable of school dropout (Gaxiola et al., 2019); therefore, a proper assessment   could   help   the   identi fi cation   of   the   speci fi c components for the promotion of skills and development of this   competence   in   the   educational   context.   Although   the importance of the SRL is recognized in specialized literature in the   achievement   of   successful   performances   and   meeting educational   demands   (Meyers   et   al.,   2013;   Gaxiola   et   al., 2019), there is a lack of studies oriented to predict dropout intention   integrating   SRL   among   other   possible   predictor variables in secondary education. The lack of instruments with adequate psychometric properties has stopped the development of studies that assess all SRL phases with different purposes and research scope. This research contributed with an instrument developed as the   fi rst objective, taking care of the respective validity evidence in the Chilean context. Subsequently, it was possible to test a composite predictive model of dropout intention by   integrating   SRL   with   external   causal   attributions,   self- evaluation   of   planning,   forced   labor   insertion,   and technological   barriers,   which   were   signi fi cant   in   predicting dropout   intention   to   quit.   The   results   of   this   model   also showed   that   the   probability   of   dropping   out   is   higher (6.8 times more) if the student is currently working. The   fi ndings of this research are consistent with previous research. A study carried out with 192 high school students in Mexico aimed to predict the risk of school dropout. The resulting model included as predictor variables the dimension of study planning related to study habits, and self-ef fi cacy for learning, related to self-regulation, explained 37.0% of the phenomenon (Hernández-Jácquez and Montes-Ramos, 2020). Another study of 808 Seattle students showed that students who presented self- regulation dif fi culties during school were linked to a lower chance of completing their studies. The results support that a low level of self-regulation   is   a   risk   factor   for   obtaining   a   diploma   in secondary education and consequently dropping out of studies (Cambron et al., 2017). Other similar studies have highlighted the importance of the SRL variable in understanding the dropout phenomenon. An investigation with 781 secondary school students in Luxembourg compared students based on their school results, forming a group that continued their studies and another that were facing school dropouts (potential dropouts versus potential school   fi nishers) (Cahuc et al., 2021). The results showed that self-regulation variables that differentiated the two groups were perseverance in effort and some learning strategies. At other academic levels, it is also possible to   fi nd consistency of the present   fi ndings. For example, an investigation carried out in the Massive Open Online Courses evaluated SRL strategies to measure their effect over the dropout   prediction   and   showed   in   their   fi ndings   that   SRL strategies have a very high predictive power (Moreno-Marcos et al., 2020). Another   signi fi cant   variable   in   the   predictive   model   of dropout   intention   was   the   technological   barrier.   In   Latin America, connectivity in secondary school education has been precarious and uneven since before the pandemic (Sáez-Delgado et al., 2020b). The current scenario imposed by the health crisis led educational institutions to propose solutions that deepened social   inequalities   and   injustices   orienting   to   provide   an immediate response, instead of a deep and effective solution. In this way, the access and daily use of ICT revealed a status of access to education and particularly in access to quality education, a basic human right, where the uneven distribution shows a critical inequality (Lusquiño, 2020). Finally, the model also revealed that forced labor insertion predicts dropout intention. Prior to the pandemic, the research had pointed to this variable as a consequence of precarious economic   family   situations   that   triggered   the   forced   labor insertion in order to satisfy the needs of the family group, putting at risk the permanence of high school students in the formal educational system (de Witte and Rogge, 2013). Other studies have considered variables measured before entering to the University, that is, data from secondary education, to understand the process of higher education transition in terms of success and intention to drop out (Lassibille and Navarro, 2008; Allensworth and Clark, 2020). For example, one study created models to identify   factors   that   in fl uence   university   performance   and identify at-risk students (Nagy and Molontay, 2018), using only data from high school students. The results of the study showed that the variables of secondary education that were included in these models have a remarkable predictive power on university graduation. Moreover, high school performance in humanities showed a large impact on the college performance of engineering students. Undoubtedly,   the   results   of   this   research   are   a   relevant contribution,   but   the   study   has   limitations.   Sample   size   is important to have more representativeness of the population. Also, the use of longitudinal designs is necessary to be able to con fi rm the associative   fi ndings of this study. This would facilitate the understanding of the phenomenon over time and the analysis of its trajectory. Finally, the use of dichotomous questions to measure some of the variables in this study is often a controversial mode of measurement that can be improved.

Participants  The sample was non-probabilistic due to accessibility, including a total of 331 secondary school students from two cities in the Biobío region from Chile. The sample of the   fi rst stage (psychometric objective) of this study consisted of 251 students, where 189 (75.3%) were men and 62 (24.7%) were women with a mean age of 16.01 (SD      1.37) years. The sample of the second stage of this study (association between variables objective) consisted of a total of 171 students, where 111 (64.9%) were men and 60 (35.1%) were women with a mean age of 15.96 (SD      1.41) years. Inclusion criteria considered secondary school students attending Municipal Administration-dependent educational establishments. Additionally, schools had technical – professional and scienti fi c – humanistic modes of teaching. The sample of this study belongs to the E-D-C3 socioeconomic classi fi cation, which means that the monthly family income is below $600,000 Chilean pesos (751.29 USD as of September 29, 2021).   The   vulnerability   index   provided   by   the   JUNAEB (National   Board   of   School   Aid   and   Scholarships;   an organization   that   provides   food   aid   and   scholarships   to students with the highest vulnerability index in the country) classi fi es these schools in a 98.7% index.  Instruments  Self-regulation of learning  Self-regulation of learning was assessed with the Scales used to measure the phases of self-regulation of learning, whose version in Spanish was validated in high school students in Ecuador (Sáez-Delgado et al., 2021). It consists of   fi ve scales whose internal consistency has been adequate in previous studies ( α   >   0.70;   Ω   >  0.70). (1) The Disposition for Study Strategies Scale measures the frequency of strategies used to analyze tasks, set objectives, and plan studies. It is one-dimensional and is formed by seven items. An item example is   “ I make a schedule to organize my study time. ”   It uses a seven-point Likert type scale, where one means  “ never ”   and 7   “ always. ”   Each item heading/slogan is   “ before you start to study or perform an academic task, how often. ”   (2) The Self-ef fi cacy Scale for Willingness to Study assesses students ’  beliefs about their ability to use study preparation strategies. It is one-dimensional and is formed by seven items. An example of an item is   “ Have a list of academic tasks to do. ”   It uses an 11-point Likert-type scale where 0 means   “ not sure at all ”   and 10 means  “ very sure. ”   The heading for each item is   “ Before I start studying, to what extent do I think I am capable of. ”   (3) The Execution Scale assesses the frequency of monitoring, cognitive, and help-seeking strategies that the student deploys during their performance on a task.   It   is   formed   by   two   subscales:   the   cognitive   and metacognitive   strategies   subscale   and   the   seek   for   help subscale. The cognitive and metacognitive strategies subscale is formed by 14 items. An item example is   “ I check my study progress. ”   The seek for help subscale is formed by three items. An item example is   “ I know where to   fi nd people that can help me. ”   It uses a seven-point Likert-type scale where 1 means   “ never ”   and 7 means   “ always ” . The heading for each item is   “ When I am studying or executing an academic task. ”   (4) The Scale of Causal Attributions assesses beliefs about internal and external factors related to poor performance. It is formed by two subscales: a subscale about causal failure attributions related to effort and ability and a subscale of causal failure attributions related to external factors. The subscale about causal failure attributions related to effort and ability is formed by three items. An item example is   “ My study disorganization. ”   The subscale of causal attributions of failure related to external factors has   fi ve items. An item example is   “ The lack of motivation of the teacher. ”   It uses an 11-point Likert-type scale where 0 is   “ I don ’ t think that is so ”   and 10 is   “ I ’ m pretty certain that it is so. ”   The heading for each item is:  “ To what extent I believe that the reason of my performance failure is due to. ”   (5) The Self-Assessment Study and Learning Scale   measures   the   frequency   of   assessment   and   re fl ection strategies over the achieved results in any academic task. It is one-dimensional and has 14 items. An item example is:   “ I evaluate if I met my personal learning challenges. ”   It uses a seven-point Likert-type scale where one means   “ never ”   and seven means   “ always. ”   The heading for each item is   “ When I   fi nish my study or an academic assignment, how often I check if. ”  The psychometric study about the properties of the Scales that measure the phases of self-regulation of learning in secondary school students in Chile is presented in the results that respond to the   fi rst objective of this research.  Dropout intention  A systematic review on abandonment intention revealed that no research used a full scale to assess this variable. Studies used related constructs although the majority created questions (Sáez- Delgado et al., 2020a). For this research, the abandonment intention   construct   will   be   understood   as   the   estimated probability of permanently suspending studies by the student. This refers to the informed intention of students to abandon their formal academic training, considered as an early warning sign of real dropout (Bean and Metzner, 1985). To assess this variable, we elaborated a question with a dichotomous answer (yes/no): Related to the current pandemic situation, have you had the intention of dropping out from studies?  Forced labor insertion  For this research, the construct of forced labor insertion will be understood as any economic activity carried out by students who have not completed their training in secondary school (ILO, 2017). To assess this variable, we elaborated a question with a dichotomous answer (yes/no): Related to the current pandemic situation, have you worked to contribute economically to your family income?  Technological barriers  The Technological Barriers construct will be understood as the technological dif fi culties that the student has for its access or use (Dinc, 2019). To assess this variable, we elaborated the following question with a dichotomous answer (yes/no): Do you have a computer or other technological device with internet access that allows you to participate in synchronous lessons?  Procedures  For the   fi rst stage of the study, three steps were followed: (1) content validation through expert judges, (2) validation of the instrument ’ s response format through cognitive interviews, and  Frontiers in Education | www.frontiersin.org   December 2021 | Volume 6 | Article 801865 3  Sáez-Delgado et al.

(3) validation of the dimensional structure through con fi rmatory factor analysis. A content validation protocol was drawn up and sent to seven expert judges, intentionally selected in base of their academic career,   fi ve of them with a doctoral degree and two with a master ’ s degree, all with at least one publication on the SRL topic. They were invited to collaborate in the validation process and informed about the research objectives through an email. Voluntarily they agreed to participate, completing an assigned form with an assessment of each scale item. The assessment consisted of the item meets or does not meet the criteria of clarity, relevance, suf fi ciency, and coherence with their respective dimension. The Kappa index was 0.96, which indicates a high degree of agreement among the judges; therefore, no modi fi cations were necessary. Afterward, seven cognitive interviews were carried out with secondary school students. They were selected to identify any comprehension problems in the items, thereby contributing to the scale ’ s response validity. Participants of these interviews signed the respective ethical consents. The results showed that the students understood all the instructions and the meaning of the items; therefore, no modi fi cations were made. Finally, authorization was requested from the school directors, previously invited to participate in the study. Informed consents were requested to the parents of the students invited to the research. Due to the social distancing restrictions resulting from the health crisis imposed by the COVID-19   pandemic,   all   consents   were   applied   using technological tools. An informed assent was requested from the students, which was included in the   fi rst section of the link sent through the SurveyMonkey tool. Only in the case of those who agreed to participate was the instrument displayed to be completed. The second part of the study, which involved a new data collection, followed all the ethical guidelines adapted to the possibilities provided by technological tools.  Data analysis  A con fi rmatory factor analysis (CFA) was carried out to meet the  fi rst objective of this research. It was performed over the   fi ve scales that assess all SRL phases. To assess the goodness of   fi t, the following indices were   selected: root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) with a 90% con fi dence interval (CI), comparative   fi t index (CFI), and Tucker – Lewis index (TLI), considering the following criteria: (a) CFI or TLI above 0.90 and (b) RMSEA less than 0.07 (Wang and Wang, 2019). Analysis was   carried   out   in   Mplus Version   8.6   software.   Prediction analysis, corresponding to the second objective of this study, involved a binary logistic regression model because the variable abandonment intention was answered in a dichotomous way (YES/NO). To assess the model, the likelihood ratio was used. This test calculates the signi fi cance of the difference in residuals between the model of interest and the null model. To determine the individual signi fi cance of each predictor introduced in a logistic regression model, the Z statistic and the Wald chi-test were used.  RESULTS First objective results: self-regulation of learning scales CFA  Results show that the   fi ve scales adjustment indices met the adequate criteria suggested in the literature RMSEA   ≤   0.07; CFI and TLI   >   0.92 and SRMR   < 0.08 (Hair et al., 2014). Although chi square is signi fi cant, the sensitivity of this test to large sample sizes is well known ( > 200) (Kline, 2011), see   Table 1 . In some scales, the relative adjustment indicators showed, in the   fi rst solution, not optimal indices according to the literature. To respecify the model, the modi fi cation indices (MI) were revised. In the willingness to study scale, pairs of residues were found between item 7   “ I identify the academic tasks I will carry out   fi rst ”   and item 3   “ I tidy up the materials I need to study ”   (IM      25,104). These items refer to the way students organize themselves. In the self-ef fi cacy scale for willingness to study, pairs of residues were found between item 7   “ Find a comfortable place to study (light, t   ° , ventilation) ”   and item 5   “ Choose   a   place   to   study   without   distractions ”   (MI     24,548). These items refer to the environmental conditions for a proper study. In the execution/performance scale, pairs of residuals were found between item 9   “ I write down my doubts to ask the teacher ”   and item 10   “ I meet the study objectives ”   (MI     15,572). These items refer to the monitoring of study and learning. In the study and learning self-assessment scale, pairs of residuals were found between item 3   “ I performed the tasks at the established times ”   and item 4   “ I evaluate if I met the academic requirements set by the teacher ”   (IM      17,568). These items refer to   the   self-assessment   of   compliance   with   the   established planning. As is shown in   Table 2 , four scales were univariate.

determine the association between self-regulation of learning, forced labor insertion, technological barrier, and intention to quit during COVID-19. The results obtained are then discussed, and the limitations and   fi nally the practical implications of the study are presented. A   study   that   systematized   SRL   assessment   instruments revealed the scarcity of available scales to be used in Latin America.   The   few   alternatives   in   Spanish   language   where strongly criticized since they focus on only one or two of SRL phases, but they do not consider the complexity of the construct (López-Angulo et al., 2020). Therefore, the result of this study responds to the goal of having instruments that fully measure the construct of SRL based on the classical theoretical models of this research topic. Moreover, it makes available valid and reliable scales to measure the phases of SRL in Chile (Morelli et al., 2021).

Despite the limitations described above, the   fi ndings of this research are relevant if the indices of inequalities and the violation of rights associated with the dissatisfaction of basic needs are considered, in this case education, which is a universal right. Not only the de fi ciency but also the existing gaps for the quality of education are highlighted. School dropout rates are considered one of the main educational problems that governments must address internationally, due to their negative impact on both individuals and society. Despite multiple attempts to understand and address this phenomenon, there are many students who continue to abandon their studies prematurely, thus reducing their   possibilities   for   personal,   professional,   and   social advancement,   and   limiting   their   contribution   to   the development   and   innovation   of   society   in   which   they   live (Antúnez et al., 2016). Researchers are encouraged to continue the development of studies to contribute to a deep understanding of the phenomenon, allowing an effective response to high school dropouts.
