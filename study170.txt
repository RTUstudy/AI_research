Italy, which has the sec -  ond lowest percentage of graduates (28%) between the ages  of 25 and 34 among EU nations, is severely affected by this  problem. In fact, Italy has a 13.1 per cent dropout rate for  18–24-year-olds, higher than the European average of 9.9  per cent (European Commission,   2021 ).  Identifying student characteristics that improve academic  success is a strategy to reduce dropout rates, encourage  further education and promote the well-being of the adult  population (Mazzetti et al.,   2020 ). Supporting students’ aca -  demic success also contributes to increasing well-being and  preventing educational poverty, improving the professional  Marcella Floris  marcella.floris2@unibo.it  Giulia Paganin  giulia.paganin2@unibo.it  Dina Guglielmi  dina.guglielmi@unibo.it  Greta Mazzetti  greta.mazzetti@unibo.it  1   Department of Education Studies, University of Bologna, Via  Filippo Re, 6, Bologna 40126, Italy  2   Department of medical and chirugical sciences, University of  Bologna, Via Palagi, 9, Bologna 40138, Italy  Abstract  Italy is among the EU countries with the lowest rates of college graduates. Preventing dropout rates, promoting bet -  ter educational achievement and improving adult population well-being can all be accomplished by discovering factors  that promote higher academic success. Thus, the current study’s goal is to investigate personal factors that may have an  impact on academic achievement (in terms of grade point average [GPA] and number of exams passed). We assume that  identified academic motivation will indirectly affect academic achievement via students’ perceived competence in career  planning and through their capacity to regulate effort in learning. The present study was conducted at the Department of  Agri-Alimentar Science and Technology of a huge university in northern Italy. A sample of 348 students (40.5% male;  M age = 21.13 years; SD age =   2.14) voluntarily filled an online questionnaire. Analysis on collected data were performed using  structural equation modelling using the Mplus software. The obtained results provided support to the hypothesized asso -  ciation between identified motivation and GPA, via the serial mediation of confidence in career planning and significant  learning effort regulation (β   =   0.10, SE   =   0.03,   p   =   .006 ), and between identified motivation and exams passed through the  serial mediation of confidence in career planning and learning effort regulation (β   =   0.10, SE   =   0.02,   p   =   .009 ). Our study  extended the body of research on the association between identified academic motivation and academic achievement, by  investigating the presence of some elements that mediate this relationship. The findings have several practical implica -  tions: in particular, they may be used to design specific actions to promote the educational success of university students  – for example, the provision of specific training regarding learning effort management, without neglecting the importance  of students’ looking toward their own professional future.

Current Psychology (2024) 43:9280–9289 (Schneider & Preckel,   2017 ). With respect to the latter vari -  able, we confirmed our second hypothesis: in fact, we con -  firmed the association between learning effort regulation  and GPA (H2a) and the number of exams passed (H2b).  These results are in line with previous studies (Kizilcec et  al.,   2017 ; Schneider & Preckel,   2017 ). In a nutshell, the bet -  ter students can manage their efforts and energies toward the  goal, the higher their academic achievement.  With respect to our third hypothesis, regarding confi -  dence in career planning, surprisingly we found results  that were completely opposite to those indicated by the lit -  erature. In fact, we found a negative and significant effect  on GPA (H3a), and we did not find an association with the  number of exams passed (H3b). Therefore, it appears that  students who show greater confidence in career planning  have lower GPAs. One possible explanation for this result  is that the more confident students are about entering the  world of work, the more they are driven to accept any grade  in order to finish the course sooner. Furthermore, it is pos -  sible that students who are more inclined to enter the world  of work will occupy their time by participating in various  extra-university activities that could enrich their CV (e.g.,  volunteering, internships, work placements) and conceive  this to be a priority, rather than taking all exams quickly and  with high grades.  Finally, the direct association between confidence in  career planning and learning effort regulation was sup -  ported by current results. Our findings are in line with pre -  vious studies suggesting that college university students  who are more convincing and focused on their professional  passed. Specifically, the findings of the current study help to  delve further into the role of personal resources and identi -  fied academic motivation for promoting the academic suc -  cess of university students.  Regarding our first hypothesis, we did not confirm the  direct effect of identified motivation on academic achieve -  ment. Specifically, we did not find a direct association  between motivation and GPA (H1a) and the number of  exams passed (H1b). These findings are not in line with the  previous literature. However, the present study represents  preliminary evidence that there is an indirect relationship  between identified motivation and academic achievement,  mediated by other variables.  On the other hand, in line with previous studies, the cur -  rent results indicate a positive direct association between  identified motivation and confidence in career planning  (H1c) and learning effort regulation (H1d). In other words,  students who decide to enrol at university because they  are driven by professional goals also perceive themselves  as more confident in their career planning and more able  to regulate their effort in learning. This finding aligns with  previous evidence suggesting that being prompted to invest  in studying specifically by work-related goals could lead  to developing a more positive view of one’s future and,  as a result, having greater confidence in one’s ability to  plan a career path (Sung et al.,   2013 ). Similarly, individu -  als characterized by instrumental motivation to achieve a  goal-   in this case a career   - develop betters abilities to man -  age and regulate one’s learning-related efforts, with more  judicious expenditure of energy during their time at college  Fig. 1.

Current Psychology (2024) 43:9280–9289 and social prospects of families and society at large (Barg -  mann et al.,   2022 ).  Therefore, general purpose of this study is to investigate  the personal factors that affect academic achievement (i.e.,  GPA and exams passed). It especially looks at how identi -  fied academic motivation, capacity for long-term planning,  and effort management affect students’ academic success.  The self-determination theory (SDT; 1985; 2012), devel -  oped by Deci and Ryan, is the foundational theories for  framing the study.  Theoretical framework of identified academic  motivation  Deci and Ryan’s ( 1985 ;   2012 ) self-determination theory  (SDT) is a modern, fast-growing theory that allows us to  discriminate between different forms of motivation based  on the causes and aims that drive an individual to engage  in certain behaviour. This theory proposes a distinction  between intrinsic motivation, which motivates people to do  something because it is intrinsically engaging or attractive,  and extrinsic motivation, which pushes people to do some -  thing because it has a certain outcome (Ryan & Deci,   2000 ,  p.55).  According to SDT, intrinsically motivated learners per -  ceive study as an engaging, enjoyable, and rewarding activ -  ity, and as a result, they engage and behave with a strong  sense of purpose: as a result, intrinsically motivated behav -  iour is autonomous or self-determined (Ryan & Deci,   2000 ).  Extrinsically motivated students, on the other hand, study  at university for the instrumental value of this behaviour,  such as gaining a better job once they graduate. The various  styles of regulating students’ academic motivation reflect  their levels of autonomy, and motivation is better explained  as a continuum from a motivation (absence of motivation)  to intrinsic motivation via extrinsic motivation. The qual -  ity of extrinsic motivation varies according to the extent to  which a behaviour is autonomous or self-determined (Ryan  & Deci,   2000 ).  Identified motivation is the most autonomous and self-  determined form of extrinsic motivation (Deci & Ryan,  2012 ), and it is typical of students who choose to attend  university since it is important for their career and personal  development (Girelli et al.,   2018 ). This sort of academic  motivation differs from intrinsic motivation in that the stu -  dent’s purpose is for success and behaviour (e.g., studying)  to have instrumental value rather than being motivated by  topic interest or personal enjoyment. Students who report  identified academic motivation have an internal locus of  control: they engage time and energy in studying because  they understand the potential reward, therefore identifying  with the task’s relevance (Liu et al.,   2019 ). In other words,  identified motivation characterizes behaviours (in this case,  college study) that an individual selects voluntarily and is  regarded as autonomous since it entails purposeful approval  of the behaviour (Guay et al.,   2020 ).  Studies have found that autonomous motivational con -  trol has a positive effect on college student success (e.g.,  Ramos Salazar & Meador,   2023 ). In recent years, several  studies have begun to focus on other types of motivation  independently, such as identified motivation, and are begin -  ning to produce evidence to support the association with  greater academic achievement. Students that have identi -  fied motivation put in more effort, have a positive perspec -  tive regarding their future and the chance of achieving their  goals and can adopt successful techniques to overcome  setbacks and problems (Nishimura & Joshi,   2021 ). Other  research has found that autonomously motivated university  students are less likely to drop out (Howard et al.,   2021 ; Lit -  alien & Guay,   2015 ), and they also report a higher level of  adaption (Girelli et al.,   2018 ). This association appears to be  explained by the fact that students with more autonomous  motivation perceive themselves as more competent (Ryan  & Deci,   2000 ) and behave adaptively since their will and  volition guide them (Litalien & Guay,   2015 ).  The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of  autonomous motivation and to determine whether and how  identified motivation (which is autonomous yet extrinsic)  effects the academic performance of university students.  Therefore, we made the first assumption:  Hypothesis 1   Identified academic motivation is positively  associated with grade point average (GPA) (H1a), the num -  ber of exams passed (H1b), confidence in career planning  (H1c), and the ability to regulate effort in learning (H1d).  Proposed sequence between theoretical constructs  Identified academic motivation has been identified as a sort  of regulation that is highly linked to occupational interests.  As a result, we recommend expanding our understanding  of the significance of this personal resource in improving  students’ academic achievement, beginning with the find -  ings of Litalien and Guay ( 2015 ). Litalien and Guay ( 2015 )  assume that autonomous motivational regulation predicts  perceived competence within the theoretical framework of  SDT (Deci & Ryan,   1985 ,   2012 ), in contrast to conceptual  models that consider perceived competence to be predictive  of interests and motivations (e.g., Lent and Brown,   2013 ’s  Career Self-Management model). According to the authors,  autonomous motivation motivates students to exert more  effort in learning activities (for example, producing new  ideas, questioning the utility of what they study, and so on). 1 3  9281

Page 3:
Current Psychology (2024) 43:9280–9289 This behavioural pattern leads them to improve their study  skills and perceive themselves as more competent. Later  studies have also supported this process (Guay et al.,   2020 ).  According to the empirical evidence discussed, it may be  argued that identified academic motivation – which repre -  sents a subtype of autonomous motivation – may be related  to self-regulated learning strategies. In fact, self-regulated  learning is defined as a self-directed process that enables  students to convert their mental skills into academic skills  (Zimmerman,   2002 ). A key strategy for self-regulated learn -  ing is effort regulation, understood as the ability to pace  one’s energy to optimize learning processes, persisting in the  face of difficult situations in studies. Schneider and Preckel  ( 2017 ) identified the ability to modify one’s effort as one  of the top 13 characteristics related with academic achieve -  ment in higher education in a remarkable meta-analysis.  Academic motivation and effort regulation are thought to be  inextricably linked and are both key predictors of academic  achievement (Kizilcec et al.,   2017 ; Umemoto,   2021 ). In  fact, it is reasonable to assume that students driven by iden -  tified motivation are more likely to engage in self-regulated  learning strategies because they are motivated by personally  meaningful goals and are proactive in completing univer -  sity assignments. As a result, the strategy that leads to high  outcomes is not constantly working at their best, but rather  being able to pick when and where to invest time and men -  tal resources (Schneider & Preckel,   2017 ). This emphasizes  the significance of considering this component in enhancing  university students’ academic achievement.  In accordance with these contributions, let us assume:  Hypothesis 2   Effort regulation is associated with a higher  GPA (H2a) and a greater number of passed exams (H2b).  Our research also looks at the role of confidence in career  planning, that refers to a student’s belief in his or her capac -  ity to plan the steps required to complete a career project  (Nota et al.,   2008 ). Active career planning comprises the  process of building, reconstructing, and forming a cohe -  sive and meaningful identity (Savickas,   2002 ). Previous  research indicates that university students who engage in  proactive career-planning behaviors regard themselves as  more employable (Chiesa et al.,   2020 ), implying that they  will be able to stay their current job or find an equivalent or  better one in the future (Vanhercke et al.,   2014 ). Kleine and  colleagues ( 2022 ) demonstrated how university students’  career-planning skills and work-related self-efficacy help  alleviate dysfunctional future ideas and career anxiety. In  other words, students who have confidence in their ability  to plan their careers tend to be more upbeat about the future  because they feel capable of meeting the challenges that lie  ahead. Furthermore, studies have revealed that students who  have a strong future orientation, that is, who are involved  in career-planning activities, are more successful academi -  cally, as measured by higher GPA (Mazzetti et al.,   2020 ).  As consequently, students who perceive reasons related to  their formative-professional identity as the primary reason  for studying in university education (that is, who have an  identifiable academic motive) feel more competent and con -  fident about their career-planning abilities. For the reasons  listed, let us assume:  Hypothesis 3   Confidence in career planning is positively  associated with GPA (H3a) and with the number of exams  passed (H3b).  Recent studies have shown a positive relationship between  university students’ career maturity, self-regulated learning  strategies and employability (Hsu et al.,   2022 ). University  students who are more confident and clearer about their job  aspirations can self-regulate their learning and direct their  efforts more successfully during their academic experi -  ence. These same students work hard to examine, monitor,  and adapt their learning processes to attain better results  (Beishuizen & Steffens,   2011 ). From this perspective, self-  regulated learning strategies are adaptive behaviours that  enable university students not only to achieve short-term  positive outcomes (e.g., higher grades or a higher number  of passed exams) but are considered important in the career-  building process (Hsu et al.,   2022 ). However, the relation -  ship between this specific career resource and self-regulated  learning strategies (such as effort regulation) is far from  clear. We aim to understand whether confidence in one’s  own career planning abilities leads the student to enhance  the ability to regulate effort. In other words, we believe  that students who are more optimistic and proactive about  their planning skills could effectively orchestrate their effort  towards academic tasks. For these reasons, we hypothesise:  Hypothesis 4   Confidence in career planning is positively  associated with student’s effort regulation in learning.  Considering the theoretical premises presented, we consider  that the positive association between identified academic  motivation and academic achievement may be mediated by  other student characteristics, hence we also hypothesise the  following indirect relationships:  Hypothesis 5   The positive impact of identified academic  motivation on academic grade point average (GPA) is 1 3  9282

The first survey’s page sum -  marized basic information about the goals of the project and  emphasized the confidentiality of respondents’ data and that  the data would be analysed in aggregate; participation in  this study was voluntary and participants had the option to  withdraw from the study at any time. After the presentation,  students were invited to voluntarily fill out an online survey.  Participants  A total of 348   s- and third-year students (40.5% male)  voluntarily filled out the online questionnaire. The aver -  age age of the respondents was 21.13 years ( SD   =   2.14).  In Table   1   were reported participants’ socio-demographic  characteristics.  Measures  Identified academic motivation   was assessed using the Ital -  ian version of the Identified Regulation subscale taken from  the Academic Motivation Scale-AMS (Vallerand et al.,  1993 ; It. version: Zurlo et al.,   2023 ). This scale includes  four items (e.g., “Because I think that finishing the degree  will allow me to work in a field that I enjoy”) that corre -  spond to different reasons behind students’ decision to apply  to university. Each item were rated on a 7-point Likert scale,  from 1 (does not match at all) to 7 (matches exactly). The  reliability of this scale in the current study was α   =   0.82.  Effort regulation   was assessed using one of the subscale  of the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire-  MSLQ (effort regulation; Pintrich et al.,   1993 ). A typical  translation–back-translation procedure was performed to  translate items from English to Italian, and two items were  marginally modified to be valid for the entire course syl -  labus, rather than to a specific course. The scale consisted  of four items with a Likert scale from 1 (does not match at  all) to 7 (matches exactly). The internal consistency of the  scale was α   =   0.70.  Confidence in career planning   was measured using four  items taken from the Italian version of the Career Decision  Self-Efficacy Scale-Short Form (CDSES-SF; Italian ver -  sion: Nota et al.,   2008 ). We decided to use the Planning sub -  scale, which measures perceived competence in planning  the steps necessary to carry out an educational or profes -  sional project, through a response scale that ranged from 1  (I am not confident) to 5 (I am fully confident). One item  of the original version of the scale was removed because it  was considered not applicable to the objective of the study  (identify employers, companies, institutions important for  1   www.qualtrics.com .  serially mediated by the perceived ability to plan one’s  future career and the ability to regulate effort in learning.  Hypothesis 6   The positive impact of identified academic  motivation on the number of passed exams is serially medi -  ated by the perceived ability to plan one’s future career and  the ability to regulate effort in learning.  Method  The present study is part of a larger project that aim to  assess the students’ needs throughout their academic careers  and to develop tools and measures to enhance their skills  for academic success. Data collection was conducted in  the Department of Agri-Food Science and Technology of a  huge university in northern Italy. This department currently  includes eight bachelor’s degree programmes and six mas -  ter’s degree programmes. Study participants belonged to  seven bachelor’s degree courses: Viticulture and Enology;  Food Technology; Animal Production; Economics and Mar -  keting in the Agro-Industrial System; Green and Landscape  Science and Technology; Land Use and Agroforestry Tech -  nology; Agricultural Technology.  Recruitment strategy  Members of the research team and undergraduate mentors  presented the general project aimed at degree programme  coordinators and students. A properly trained research assis -  tant went to the university classrooms during class hours and,  after sharing with participants the purpose of the survey and  emphasizing the non-compulsory nature of participation,  Table 1   Sociodemographic data of the sample  M (SD)   N (%)   Ranges  Age   21.13  (2.14)  19–57  Gender   Male   141 (40.5)  Female   103 (29.6)  Other   104 (29.9)  Year   Second   172 (49.4)  Third   176 (50.6)  Course   Viticulture and Enology   25 (7.2)  Food Technology   66 (19.0)  Animal Production   50 (14.4)  Economics and Market -  ing in the Agro-Industrial  System  70(20.1)  Ornamental Green and  Landscape Protection  33 (9.5)  Land and Agro-Forestry  Technology  18 (5.1)  Agricultural Technology   86 (24.7) 1 3  9283

Current Psychology (2024) 43:9280–9289 focused on strengthening evidence regarding the positive  effects of intrinsic motivation, such as building meaningful  and lasting learning (e.g., Diaconu-Gherasim et al.,   2020 ;  Liu,   2021 ). Rather, at university, it might be more impor -  tant to develop an identified motivation, both to achieve  better academic results as well as to decrease intentions  to drop out of studies, as evidenced by experimental (e.g.,  Burton et al.,   2006 ), longitudinal (e.g., Liu et al.,   2019 ) and  meta-analysis (e.g., Howard et al.,   2021 ) research. In fact,  especially in European universities, it is quite common that  during their academic studies, students have to deal with  courses included as compulsory subjects that are not neces -  sarily in line with their educational interests. In this regard,  students who develop an identified motivation recognize  the instrumental value of that action, identifying with it and  this allows them to persevere even when confronted with  content that is not entirely appealing to them but that they  recognize as useful for the professional goal they wish to  achieve after graduation.  The fact that students’ personal characteristics/resources  and career strategies have been linked can be considered an  innovative aspect of the current study: to our knowledge,  no other research has explored the link between identified  motivation, confidence in career planning, and self-regu -  lated learning strategies at the same time. The current study  examines the process that leads students with identified  motivation to achieve better academic results (in terms of  GPA and the number of exams), looking for the presence  of some elements that mediate this relationship, as sug -  gested previous research (e.g., Burton et al.,   2006 ). So far,  it has not been determined which precise behaviours and  personal resources are brought into play by the student  when internalizing the significance of a goal, but this study  may improve understanding in this respect. Indeed, having  an identified motivation helps the student to create mental  planning scripts on how to pursue his or her goals (both aca -  demic and professional) and to implement self-regulating  effort behaviours to achieve them.  A significant and long-term objective, such as complet -  ing a degree, necessitates a commitment to learn new activi -  ties, build and enhance skills, and sustain a constant effort.  As a result, developing identification with a goal and adopt -  ing a mindset that allows for the overcoming of challenges  can be a fundamental challenge in pursuing it (Burton et al.,  2006 ; Howard et al.,   2021 ).  From a practical point of view, this study can provide  guidance for the design of orientation and personal resource  promotion interventions that can serve to encourage stu -  dents’ academic career completion. Other studies have  demonstrated the usefulness of vocational motivation and  self-efficacy training programs (lectures, tutorials, face-  to-face meetings) aimed at improving university students’  aspirations are better able to self-regulate their learning and  focus their efforts during the educational process. These stu -  dents try to evaluate, track and modify their learning proce -  dures in their efforts to achieve fruitful results (Beishuizen  & Steffens,   2011 ).  Regarding   our   indirect   hypotheses,   we   confirm   the  association between both identified motivation and aca -  demic achievement, respectively GPA (H5) and the num -  ber of exams passed (H6) confirm the association between  identified motivation and academic achievement, respec -  tively GPA (H5) and the number of exams passed (H6),  via the serial mediation of confidence in career planning  and learning effort regulation. Although, to the best of our  knowledge, this is only the beginning of an investigation  into this relationship, the findings can be explained using  the literature that is now in existence. As previously men -  tioned, several studies had emphasized the association of  identified motivation with academic achievement (Ramos  Salazar & Meador,   2023 ) although the full understanding  of the underlying mechanism is far from being achieved.  According to our results, the association between motiva -  tion and GPA and the number of passed exams is significant  and positive when the relationship is boosted by great levels  of confidence in career planning and learning effort man -  agement. When students with identified motivation believe  that attending college is beneficial and functional for their  careers (e.g., it enables them to work in the sector of their  interest), they also report greater confidence in their capac -  ity to make plans for the future of their careers. As a result,  university students exhibiting a high ability to balance their  efforts also optimize the learning process, maximize energy,  develop meaningful learning and achieve higher academic  success in terms of GPA and the number of exams passed.  Theoretical and practical implications  From a theoretical perspective, the research findings over -  come the limitations of previous research in several ways.  First, this study is the combination of subjective data as  predictors (self-reported measures) and objective data as  outcome (GPA and number of exams passed), in line with  suggestions of previous research that has emphasized the  value of using objective data to understand which variables  actually affect academic outcomes more realistically, as  self-reported measures are not always reliable (Caskie et al.,  2014 ).  Secondly, most published studies using the theoretical  framework of SDT (Ryan & Deci,   2000 ) concern the inves -  tigation of the effects of motivation quality on indicators of  academic success in the primary or secondary school con -  text, whereas our study is specific to the university envi -  ronment. Moreover, most research on study motivation has 1 3  9287

The last point appears to be particularly pertinent, especially  when considering the social and economic costs associated  with high university dropout rates.  Limitations and future directions  In addition to its strengths, such as the use of objective data,  this research also has some limitations. Firstly, the research  adopted a cross-sectional design, which allows us to analyse  only associations between variables. Future research could  examine the long-term mediating impacts of confidence in  career planning and effort regulation, in order to identify  cause-effect relationships between constructs. Secondly,  the research involved students from only one department of  an Italian university, so the results cannot be generalised to  the entire university population. In fact, we have no way of  verifying in an absolute sense that the results of our study  are applicable to all university contexts. Although the per -  formance indicators we have included (GPA and number of  exams passed) are the same as those used in other research  in other countries (e.g., Greco et al.,   2022 ), the number  of exams included in the university curriculum may vary  considerably from institution to institution. This aspect  may make it difficult to implement the study from a cross-  cultural perspective and for this reason the results obtained  should be interpreted in the light of the specificity of the  context in which they could be applied.

Current Psychology (2024) 43:9280–9289 the goodness of fit of the CFA and successive model, the fol -  lowing indices and cut-off criteria were considered (Byrne,  2001 ): the RMSEA (values between 0.08 and 0.05 suggest  an appropriate fit of the model); the SRMR (values below  0.08 are considered a good fit); the CFI, (values above 0.90  are indicative of a reasonably good model fit) and the TLI;  (Tucker–Lewis Index; values between 0.90 and 0.95 are  indicative of an acceptable fit).  The CFA findings (see Table   3 ) demonstrated that the  five-factor model, including identified motivation, effort  regulation, confidence in career planning, number of exams  passed and GPA, indicated the best fit to our data when com -  pared to competitive solutions (χ2(67)   =   159.06,   p   =   .000,  RMSEA  =   0.04,   SRMR   =   0.05;   CFI   =   0.93;   TLI   =   0.90).  This result confirms that the measures used in the current  study have discriminant validity. In line with modification  indices suggested by MPlus for increasing the fit indices of  the final model, the change indices were inspected. Thus,  the model fit was increased by correlating the error terms  of two items of the Identified Motivation Scale (“Because  I think that finishing the course of study will allow me to  work in a field I like” and “Because I think that finishing  the course of study will help me to better choose the profes -  sion I would like to do”) and four items from the Career  Planning Scale (“Make a plan to achieve your goals for the  next five years” and “Identify the necessary steps to suc -  cessfully complete your chosen education”; “Properly pre -  pare a CV” and “Successfully handle a job interview”):  χ2(64)   =   110.14,   p   =   .000,   RMSEA  =   0.03,   SRMR   =   0.04,  CFI   =   0.96, TLI   =   0.95.  Direct effects  Direct effects are reported in Table   4 . GPA reported a non-  significant association with the course year. On the contrary,  the course year is associated with the number of exams  passed (β   =   0.69, SE   =   1.37,   p   =   .000 ). Regarding H1a and  H1b, identified motivation showed a non-significant asso -  ciation with GPA (β   = -0.05, SE   =   0.16,   p   =   .671 ) and exams  passed (β   = -0.30, SE   =   0.25,   p   =   .345 ). Concerning H1c  and H1d, identified motivation did show a significative  association respectively with confidence in career planning  (β   = -0.43, SE   =   0.06,   p   =   .000 ) and with effort regulation  your possible professional employment). The reliability of  this scale was found to be α   =   77.  Academic achievement (student’s GPA and exams passed)  Objective data on students’ GPAs and the number of exams  passed were.  provided by the university’s administrative staff. Accord -  ing to the Italian academic system, grades are expressed on  a 30/30 basis, and the minimum grade required to achieve  proficiency is 18 out of 30.  Data analysis  Data were checked for outliers, multicollinearity, and nor -  mality distribution using SPSS 28. To test our model, the  Mplus 8 software (Muthen & Muthen,   2017 ) was employed  to estimate a structural equation model (SEM). Using the  maximum   likelihood   (ML)   methodology,   we   first   per -  formed confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Next, we tested  our direct and indirect effects hypothesis.  Results  Descriptive statistics  Since the lowest tolerance statistic of 0.79 and the greatest  variance inflation factor of 1.27 were both well below the  suggested cut-off of 10, there was no evidence of multicol -  linearity. Skewness levels (ranging from 0.32 to   −   0.85) and  kurtosis values (ranging from 0.52 to   −   0.62) were accept -  able. In Table   2   we reported means and standard deviations,  as well as correlations between the study variables. All sig -  nificant relationships among variables were in the expected  direction. Furthermore, as indicated along the table diago -  nal, all scales reported an internal consistency value (Cron -  bach’s alpha) exceeding the criterion of 0.65 (DeVellis, &  Thorpe,   2021 ).

Current Psychology (2024) 43:9280–9289 (β   =   0.22, SE   =   0.09,   p   =   .014 ). Therefore, our first hypoth -  eses   were   partially   supported.   Regarding   our   second  hypothesis, effort regulation showed a significant positive  association with GPA (H2a; β   =   0.62, SE   =   0.26,   p   =   .000 )  and with the number of exams passed (H2b; β   =   0.38  SE   =   0.34,   p   =   .000 ). Regarding confidence on career plan -  ning, our results underlined a significant and negative asso -  ciation with the GPA (H3a; β   = -0.25, SE   =   0.33,   p   =   .015 )  and a non-significant direct effect on exams passed (H3b;  β   = -0.10, SE   =   0.42,   p   =   .254 ). Finally, regarding H4, the  obtained results indicate a direct significant association  between career planning and learning effort management  (β   =   0.34, SE   =   0.02,   p   =   .003 ). Therefore, our direct effects  hypotheses are partially supported.  Mediation analysis  With regard to the hypothesized serial mediations, the rela -  tionship between identified motivation and GPA, via con -  fidence in career planning and learning effort regulation,  was significant (H5; β   =   0.10, SE   =   0.03,   p   =   .006 , 95%CI  [0.09,0.35]) as well as the relationship between identified  motivation and exams passed through the serial mediation  of confidence in career planning and learning effort regula -  tion (H6; β   =   0.10, SE   =   0.02,   p   =   .009 , 95%CI [0.10,0.43]).  Therefore, our mediation hypotheses are supported.  Discussion  In accordance with the well-established theoretical frame -  work provided by self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan,  1985 ), the purpose of the present study was to explore ante -  cedents that may be associated with students’ academic  achievement, in terms of GPA and the number of exams  Table 3   Fit indices for the five-factor model and the alternative models  Model   χ 2   df   p   RMSEA   SRMR   CFI   TLI  One-factor model a   667.534   77   0.000   0.10   0.12   0.52   0.44  Two-factor model b   501.156   76   0.000   0.08   0.12   0.66   0.59  Three-factor model c   298.043   73   0.000   0.06   0.10   0.81   0.79  Four-factor model d   161.162   71   0.000   0.04   0.93   0.91   0.05  Five-factor model e   159.057   67   0.000   0.04   0.93   0.90   0.05  Five-factor model f   110.137   64   0.000   0.03   0.04   0.96   0.95  Note.   df   =   degree of freedom; RMSEA   =   Root Mean Square Error of Approximation; SRMR   =   Standardized Root Mean Square Residuals;  CFI   =   Comparative Fit Index; TLI   =   Tucker-Lewis Index.
