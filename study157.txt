This study   explores   the factors driving students to  choose nursing to leave their programs and the relationship between reasons for  choice and i ntentions to withdraw.  Methods & Materials:   A cross - sectional study was conducted at three public nursing  institutes in Marrakech - Safi, Morocco. Employing a consensus sampling approach  questionnaire was employed for data collection, and the data were analyzed using  SPSS software (version 22).   We used descriptive statistics to understand why students  choose nursing and why they consider dropping out. Logistic regression was utilized  to e xplore the correlation between reasons for selecting nursing and the intention to  drop   out.  Results:   Students primarily chose nursing to care for and help others   (3.72±1.12) ,  influenced   by   family/friends   (3.60±1.19),   and   a   personal   interest   in   nursing  (3.46±1.15). 28.45% of participants contemplated the idea of discontinuing their  program. This inclination was mainly attributed to unfavorable clinical placements  (3.59±1.21), psychological distress (3.38±1.28), and a tough curriculum (3.34±1.29).  Accordi ng to the predictive model, students motivated by job availability (3.587; 95%  CI, 2.914 - 4.416; p˂.001), salary prospects (1.259; 95% CI, 1.054 - 1.504; p=.011), and  opportunities for international work and/or study (1.196; 95% CI, 1.010 - 1.417;  p=.038) were   more likely to drop out.  Conclusion:   Improving clinical learning conditions, promoting a positive perception  of the nursing profession, and admitting candidates driven by the aspiration to offer  support and comfort to individuals appear to be pivotal in re taining students .

The health system,  thus,   must   provide   adequate   training   for  healthcare professionals in quantity and quality.  In Morocco, for instance, despite considerable  efforts   mad e by the state, the number of nurses  still fa lls short of the minimum requirements.  The World Health Organization ranks Morocco  among the 57 countries in the world that face an  acute shortage of nursing staff ( 1 ). Given that  the pace of recruitment in Morocco cannot keep  up with the need or   compensate for cumulative  retirements, and despite the fact that there are no  official figures on dropout rates for nursing  students, it is commonly known that the loss of  a significant number of students each year only  worsens the current shortage of nurs ing staff in  Morocco. It is worth mentioning that students  discontinuing nursing programs is not unique to  Morocco ; i t exists everywhere.   In Vietnam , for  example, the rate is as high as   32,2   % ( 2 ) . It is at  Tehran University of Medical Sciences  2024;   Volume   11 , No   1, pp. 80 - 88  DOI:   10.18502/npt.v11i1.14945  with   725   nursing   students,   696   individuals   responded.

Results  The demographic characteristics of the  students are presented in Table 1. As you can  see, women predominated, with a sex ratio  (F/M) of .30. The average age of   the students  (all options combined) was 20.58± 1.18 years,  with extremes of 18 and 35 years. By the level  of   study,   370   (53.2%)   participants   were  enrolled in the 2 nd   year and 326 (46.8%) in the  3 rd   year.   The   participants   came   from   10  different specialties,   with the majority being  general nurses 309 (44.4%).  The results presented in Table 2 show  that the five factors for selecting the nursing  profession   ranked   highest   by   the   students  according to their averages were as   follows:  desire to help and care for others (3.72±1.12),  influence of family and friends (3.60±1.19),  interest   in   nursing   (3.46±1.15),   great   job  opportunities   (3.44±1.28),   and   salary  (3.33±1.23).

A. El Fadely et al.  Nursi ng Practice Today. 2024;11(1):80 - 88   87  primary   motivation   for   students   selecting  nursing as a career. This insight should guide  stakeholders in the healthcare sector to refine  admission interviews for nursing programs and  select candid ates who possess more altruistic  motivations, such as the desire to help others,  rather than purely practical considerations like  job security, salary, or immigration.  Based   on   the   outcomes   of   our  research, we propose that those responsible for  training   nurses should develop strategies to  create a clinical environment conducive to  learning. They should also implement support  and coaching strategies to ensure that clinical  experiences offer richer learning opportunities  and   are   less   stressful   for   students.   This  approach   is   likely   to   enhance   student  motivation   and   reinforce   their   sense   of  belonging to the profession.  Furthermore, training institutes should  collaborate with professional associations to  enhance   the   public   image   of   the   nursing  profession and el evate its social status. To  achieve   this,   nurses   should   leverage   their  strategic positions and advocate through mass  media and scientific events to showcase the  real nature of their work. This concerted effort  can contribute to greater social recognition  a nd,   consequently,   help   students   leaving  school perceive nursing in a more positive  light.

Finally, socio - economic factors, such as  the social imag e of nursing as a less attractive  profession and financial difficulties ,   have been  associated with dropping out of training   ( 23 ) .  Many studies   have   focused   on the  factors that influence individuals to select a  career in nursing, whereas others have focused  on the reasons for dropping out. Th is study's  originality lies in proposing   a model that could  predict   potential   dropouts   based   on   career  choice factors. Such knowledge can help to  develop strategies for retaining   nurse   students  who may wish to leave the   training program.  The objectives of this study are to  ascertain the reasons that motivate students to  select a career in nursing, identify the factors  that contribute to their discontinuation of the  nursing program, and pinpoint the selection -  related facto rs associated with the intention to  dropout.  Method s  A multi - central cross - sectional study  was conducted between April and May 2023,  employing a consensus sampling approach.  696   nursing   students,   comprising  second and third - year attendees from three  train ing   institutes   located   in   Marrakech,  Essaouira, and Safi, took part in this study. The  institutes had enrollments of 468, 120, and 108  students,   respectively.   The   only   inclusion  criterion used was that the study participant  had to be a nursing student at o ne of the  training institutes in the Marrakech - Safi region.  Note that first - year students were excluded  from the study because newcomers have not  yet developed a clear understanding of certain  elements that this study targets, specifically the  clinical env ironment. After using a consensus  sampling   method   with   725   distributed  questionnaires,   696   were   collected,  representing a response rate of 96%.  The researchers developed a four - part  questionnaire   based on an in - depth review of  the literature. The first par t of the questionnaire  focuses on the reasons that influenced the  selection of nursing as a career (13 items on a  five - point   Likert   scale,   with   1   indicating  " strongly disagree "   and 5 indicating   " strongly  agree " ). The second part consists of a   " yes/no "  response to the question ,   " Have you ever  considered stopping your nursing program? "   If  the answer was yes, respondents were asked to  indicate their reasons in the third part. This  section   addressed   statements   justifying   the  intention to discontinue their   program   (10  items on a five - point Likert scale). Part 4  requested   data   related   to   the   participants '  educational   profile s   and   socio - demographic  information.   All   the   questionnaires   were  distributed in class during a lesson.  The   data   were   analyzed   using the  S tatistical Package for Social Sciences (version  22).   Descriptive   statistics   included   means,  standard deviations, frequency distributions,  and   percentages.   Internal   consistency   was  assessed   using   Cronbach ' s   alpha   reliability  analysis. Binary logistic regres sion analysis  was employed, with nursing students '   intention  to drop out as the dependent variable and  significant factors affecting their career choice  as   the   independent   variables.   The   alpha  threshold was set at ˂.05. The   " Stepwise "  conditional   top - down   logistic   regression  method   was   chosen,   given   the   limited  knowledge of possible predictor variables and  the less explored nature of the research field.

Nursing   aspirations   &   dropout intentions  84   Nursi ng Practice Today. 2024;11(1):80 - 88  When asked whether they had thought  of giving up their program at least once, 28.45%  (n=198) of students answered   in the affirmative.  The three main reasons given by the students  for their intention to leave the nursing program  were poor clinical placement conditions (39.9%  agree, 23.7% strongly agree), psychological  distress and stressful experiences (33.8% agree,  21 .2% strongly agree), and exhausting studies  (39.4% agree, 17.7% strongly agree). Table 3  shows   the reasons   given by students   who  intended to leave their program.  There ' s   a   relationship   between   the  intention to leave training and the initial reasons  for car eer choice.   A logistic regression model  was constructed to predict the presence or  absence of potential dropouts based on the  reasons for selecting nursing as a career . The  career choice factors significantly associated in  logistic regression analysis ( p ˂ . 05) with the  intention to stop studying are presented in Table  4.   The model obtained explains 49% of the  variance in the intention to leave   the   program  (Nagelkerke ' s R² is .491). This model is true in  84.1% of cases (overall percentage). It shows  that stud ents whose reasons for career choice  were: ease of finding a job (3.587; 95% CI,  1.054 - 1 . 5 0 4 ;   p = . 0 1 1 ) ,   a n d   o p p o r t u n i t i e s   t o   w o r k  a n d / o r   s t u d y   a b r o a d   ( 1 . 1 9 6 ;   9 5 %   C I ,   1 . 0 1 0 -  1 . 4 1 7 ;   p = . 0 3 8 )   a r e   m o r e   l i k e l y   t o   i n t e n d   l e a v i n g  t h e   n u r s i n g   p r o g r a m .

A. El Fadely et al.  Nursi ng Practice Today. 2024;11(1):80 - 88   85  Discussion  In this study, the desire to help   and  care for others ranked very high as the reason  for selecting the nursing profession. This result  comes as no surprise and is in line with what  has already emerged from previous research. A  study by Halperin and Mashiach - Eizenberg  found   identical   resul ts:   Jewish   and   Arab  nursing students said that the opportunity to  help others was the main factor that prompted  them to select the profession (46% and 34.2%,  respectively)   ( 4 ).   This   finding   is   also  confirmed by the conclusions of an Indonesian  study   of   400   nursing   students:   50%   of  participants were mainly influenced by the  desire to serve others ( 5 ). The second most  important factor was the influence of close  neighbors or friends. Marznaki et al. also  obtained similar results. The results of these  authors s how that positive recommendations  from family and friends were the main factors  motivating Iranian students to pursue a nursing  career   ( 13 ).   The   results   of   another   study  illustrated that family members and friends  exerted a significant influence on career   choice  decisions ( 5 ). Career interest came third. This  result is consistent with the findings of two  studies   which highlighted that the reasons  given by students for enrolling in nursing  programs were mainly related to a love of  nursing   ( 7 )   and   interest   in   providing  professional care ( 6 ). This was followed by  materialistic factors, namely job security and  salary. Our results corroborate the study ,   which  found that Turkish students cited the ease of  finding   a   job   as   the   main   reason   for  undertaking nursing st udies ( 8 ). Our results  also corroborate the study that showed that  income   from   the   nursing   profession   was  reported   among   the   selection   criteria   that  carried the most weight for students ( 12 ).  However, in his study, Myburgh pointed out  that some students ch oose to follow their  passion   regardless   of   how   much   money  nursing will bring them ( 24 ). This was also  confirmed by a study revealing that a good  salary had less influence on career choices ( 4 ).  The results of our study revealed that  two out of five partici pants had intended to  leave   the   nursing   program   at   some   point  during their training (28.45%). This result  appears to be lower than in other studies, as  48.85% of Canadian students had   ' sometimes '  considered   leaving   their   program   ( 22 ).  Imagining stopping on e ' s studies is, therefore,  not   uncommon. Similarly,   Cameron   et   al.  arrived at an important conclusion:   " A t least  50% of students who completed the nursing  program considered leaving at some point but  changed   their   minds "   ( 25 ).   This   finding  demonstrates tha t some individuals with the  potential to drop out can be persuaded to  r e m a i n   i n   t h e   p r o g r a m .

A c c o r d i n g   t o   M o o n e y   e t   a l . ,   i t   a p p e a r e d   t h a t  nursing was not the first career choice for all  students ( 14 ).  Similarly, the Canadian study of 156  nursin g students   found that   27   participants  (17.2%) selected nursing as their second choice  because they were unable to get into their first -  choice university ( 9 ). In the same vein, a finding  by Bolan and Grainger is that one of the main  reasons students gave fo r dropping out of the  nursing program was that they no longer liked  or wanted a career in nursing ( 17 ). In fact, to  retain students in the field of nursing, it is  essential that they have a realistic perception of  the   profession   and   that   their   professional  expectations are taken into account. Some of the  students interviewed as part of a study by Kox  et al. had wanted to become nurses since  childhood but very quickly felt, during their  training, that nursing was not the profession  they had dreamed of ( 18 ).   Bakker et al. point  out that experiencing a gap between their own  expectations and reality is one of the reasons  why student nurses abandon their program ( 3 ).  Dropping out of nursing school has  consequences not only for the cost of training  but also for th e quality of care and patient  satisfaction. Dropout is recognized as a complex  phenomenon with multiple causes. In their  study,   Bakker   et   al.   identified   academic  difficulties as a factor associated with dropout  ( 3 ).   However,   another   study indicated   that  de spite good academic results, many students  expressed that they had lost motivation to  pursue   the   nursing   program   due   to   the  unsupportive   attitude   of   teachers   ( 19 ).   In  addition to academic and relational difficulties,  negative experiences during clinical pl acements  can lead to students dropping out of training ( 3 ).  On this subject, Clements et al. argue that  clinical placement experiences can have an  impact on students '   professional identity and  commitment to their chosen profession ( 20 ).  The study conducted   by So rensen et al. showed  that several students cited busy and stressful  clinical practice as the reason for dropping out  ( 21 ). For other students, the decision to end their  nursing training was associated with feelings of  emotional   exhaustion   ( 21 ).   Psych ological  problems were among the reasons why some  students left their program ( 3 ,   22 ). Lack of work

This  demonstrates that a number of students who  unintentionally choose nursing as a career   can  be persuaded to stay in the program. Finally,  we invite other researchers to use our results as  a basis for future in - depth analysis of the issue  at   hand.   This   further   exploration   should  highlight   that   there   is,   interestingly,   no  correlation between s electing nursing as a last -  resort profession with the intention to cease  studying, which suggests that some students  who unintentionally opt for nursing as a career  can   still   be   persuaded   to   remain   in   the  program.  Study limitations  The primary limitation o f this study is  its restriction to nursing students from a single  region   of   Morocco,   which   hinders   the  generalization of the results. It is, therefore,  recommended that future research include a  national   sample.   Another   limitation   is   the  cross - sectional de sign of the study. This design  does not fully and comprehensively permit the  assessment of causality. A longitudinal study  would provide more information about discrete  dropouts who actually take action.  Conclusion  The   results   of   this   study provided  valuab le information on two fronts: first, it  sheds light on the motivating factors that attract  candidates   to   the   nursing   profession,   and  second, it uncovers the factors that contribute  to their decision to drop out of the nursing  program. Utilizing logistic re gression, we were  able to establish a clear association between six  reasons for career choice and the intention to  discontinue training. The model proposed by  our research can predict potential dropouts  based   on   their   career   choice   motivations.  Future   recr uitment   and   retention   strategies  aimed at addressing the critical shortage of  nursing staff should take into consideration  these   factors   significantly   linked   to   the  intention to drop out.  Our results, along with the reviewed  literature, highlight that the   desire to provide  support and comfort to people remains the
