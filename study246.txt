Background   Ph.D.   students’   exper iences of inte rest, burnout ,   and dropout intentions among Finnish and Danish   Ph.D.   students have not been researched before. R esearch with a person-centred approach   exploring individual variations in students un- dertaking doctoral studies in two comparable but d istinct socio- cultural contexts is limited.  Methodology   This study uses   exploratory factor analysis,   K-means   cluster analyses in combi-  nation with Pairwise comparisons, ANOVA, and Chi - square test. A total of 365 doctoral students in social sciences and humanities disciplines in Finland and  Denmark responded to a   Cross-Cultural Doctoral Experience Survey.  Contribution   This study contributes   understanding   on individual variation in doctoral stu- dents’ interest across two socio- cultural contexts by identifying   four   personal in- terest   profiles. The profiles were invariant across the contexts. The study also shed further light on the interrelation between the interest in research and   the risk   for suffering from   burnout and   entertaining   dropout intentions.

Intere st, Burnout, and Drop - Out Intentions  596  D octoral student interest   in their   doctoral studies   has been   shown to be affected by   multiple socio -  cultural and contextual attributes, such as   supervisory support and faculty   modelling   (Lee, 2018; McAlpine, 2017). However, such attributes are always individually experienced and,   hence ,   have a var- ying impact on doctoral students ’   interest. Accordingly, the individual experience may potentially re- sult   in   significant variation in   the interest   experienced   both within and across the socio- cultural con- texts. Such variation may even be greater than the impact of socio - cultural differences. Yet, we still  know little   about individual variation in doctoral students ’   interest across the different socio - cultural contexts in which the doctoral education is embedded. B URNOUT AND   D ROP   - O   UT   I NTENTIONS  D octoral education does not always provide an optimal environment for nurturing   a   doctoral stu-  dent’ s interest or study well - being (Leveque   et al., 2017; Reevy &   Deason ,   2014). Prior research has revealed   that doctoral students often experience stress and exhaustion during their doctoral studies (Hermann et al., 2014; Hunter & Divine, 2016; Peltonen   et al., 2017).   Both Danish and Finnish doc-  toral students have   been reported   as experiencing   stress   and exhaustion   during their studies (Cornér  et al., 2017; Hermann et al., 2014;   Peltonen   et al., 2017; Stubb   et al., 2011)   resulting in increased burnout risk.  Burnout has two distinctive symptoms, namely,   exhaustion and cynicism (Bakker   et al., 2008; Maslach & Leiter, 2005,   2008). Exhaustion is characterized by a lack of emotional energy and feeling strained  and tired   of   work   ( Maslach   et al., 2001).   C ynicism is characterized by   losing interest in one’s work  and perceiving it as meaningless. Cynicism may lead to   distancing and   reduced involvement   ( Maslach  & Leiter, 2008)   and   to detached responses to colleagues and other aspects of the work (Maslach, 2003).   It has been   shown that both exhaustion and cynicism emerge from work overload and is a re- sult of too heavy job demands and social struggle at work (Maslach, 2003). In the context of doc- toral education,   exhaustion (Anttila et al., 2015) and cynicism may lead to   droppin g out of   the doc- toral program   (Vekkaila   et al., 2016).  Regrettably, a significant number of doctoral students never complete their doctoral studies   ( Gard-  ner, 2009; Jones, 2013). Based on the findings of previous studies   attrition rates can range from 33% to 70% (Gardner & Gopaul, 2012; Ivankova   & Stick, 2007; Jiranek, 2010).   Also, in the Finnish and Danish context of doctoral education, there is evidence of   high drop- out intentions rates (Cornér et al., 2017, 2018).   It has been shown that research com munity integration and networks   (Castelló   et al., 2017; Graham & Massyn, 2019; Jairam & Kahl, 2012; Lovitts, 2001)   are   vital for reducing attrition rates and to enhance degree completion.  It is important to gain more knowledge on both personal interest and its relationship with   burnout  and attrition risk , since all levels in the system gain from doctoral learning environments that cultivate Ph.D.   student interest and well - being (Pyhältö et al., 2019). Evidence suggests that interest (Pyhältö et al., 2019),   exhaustion,   and cynicism among Ph.D.   students   are   associated with the risk of dropping out of the doctoral program (Anttila et al., 2015; Cornér   et al., 2017; Vekkaila et al., 2016). The litera- ture review indicates that there is a gap in the research -based knowledge with a person-centred ap- proach to   Ph.D.   students ’   interest, burnout,   and drop- out intentions in humanities and social sciences  in cross- cultural context. We intend to fill this gap and explore individual variation in doctoral stu-  dents’   interest across different socio - cultural contexts.  D   OCTORAL   E DUCATION IN   F   INLAND AND   D   ENMARK  D octoral education in Finland and Denmark   is based on   common cultural features and a robust tra- dition of public education, including   at   the university level. Both Finland and Denmark have imple-  mented the Bologna three- cycle process (Andres et al., 2015; Gudmunsson, 2008). There are no tui- tion fees   (Andres et al., 2015), they are similar in terms of overall publication productivity, and they have weighted citation impacts above the World average (Nordforsk   Policy Briefs , 2017). They also

The re-  spondents were prompted as follows: to e valuate the following statements about your interest in doctoral studies. I am doing doctoral studies because ... The items   used a seven - point scale, in which 1 = unsatis- fied/strongly disagree, 7 = completely satisfied/fully agree.   The   Burnout   scale (11   items)   includ ed two  dimensions, namely   cynicism   about doctoral studies   (4   items )   and   exhaustion   result ing   from doctoral studies   (7   items).   Dropout intentions   was   measured using a   binary item (yes/no).  A NALYSI S  After screening for outliers and normality, a series of exploratory factor analyses (EFA) were con- ducted using the Maximum L ikelihood   (ML) extraction method with Promax   rotation to determine  the underlying structure of the variables measuring   interest in d octoral studies and burnout. Results suggested retention of a four - factor solution for interest in doctoral studies and a two - factor solution for   the   burnout   scale   ( T able 2).  The EFAs were carried out with the full sample and with the two subsamples separately. The factor analyses done with subsamples produced highly similar results as the factor analyses done with the full sample. To examine doctoral students ’   interest profiles, we performed a series of K - means clus- ter analyses using the   Interest in doctoral studies   subscale scores as constituting dimensions. Two - , three - , and four - cluster solutions were tested and evaluated, based on both statistical criteria and the theoret- ical salience of the results. Based on this, a four - cluster solution was selected. Repeating the same procedure using Finnish and Danish subsamples separately confirmed the same solution. Fisher ’s one- way analysis of variance and Gabriel ’ s, and Games - Howell ’s test along with Cohen’ s d were used to investigate the differences between profiles on exhaustion and cynicism. The Chi - square test and  Cramer’ s V were used to examine the differences between the profiles on drop - out intentions.  Table 2.

The first one was   the   High interest   profile. It was the most common profile among the doctoral students,   comprising   36.9% (n = 123) of the sample. Doctoral students displaying this profile reported high average value on all inter- est subscale scores.   The second profile, the   Moderate interest   profile ,   was displayed by one quarter  (25.7%, n = 88) of the   doctoral   studen ts .   The students   with   this profile   presented   moderate levels on all interest subscale scores, except on the developmental interest level, where they displayed high lev- els. The third profile resulting from our analysis was   the   Development, research and impact interest   profile  (21.3%, n   =   73). The   doctoral   students displaying   this   profile experienced high levels of develop-  mental , research   and impact   interest, but only moderate level of instrumental   interest .   The   Develop- ment and impact interest   profile   included   the smallest number   of respondents   (17.0%, n   =   58).   The  High development   and impact interest   group displayed relatively high levels of both   developmental  and impact interest , while having only   a   moderate level of research interest and   a   low amount of in- strumental interest. As our previous notion that the K - means cluster analysis did not produce   essen-  tially different results in   the   Finnish and Danish subsamples, we found no statistically significant dif- ferences between Finnish and Danish d octoral   students on cluster memberships.

As for cynicism, the Games - Howell test revealed that the   differences   were  statistically significant   between the   Development, research and impact interest profile   and the   Development and impact interest profile   (p < .01, d = .64), between   the   Development, research and impact interest profile   and the  Moderate interest profile   (p < .001, d = 1.01), between   the   Development and impact interest profile   and the  High interest profile   (p < .05, d = .50)   and between the   High interest profile   and the   Moderate interest profile  (p < .001, d = .83). The members of   the   Moderate interest profile   reported more cynicism than the members of   the   High interest profile . In average, the members of the   Development, research and impact in- terest profile   expressed the least amount of cynicism. The profile membership also had a statistically significant relation ship with drop- out intentions ( T able 4).  The members of the first and third profiles,   Development, research and impact interest   and the   High interest,  were least likely to harbour thoughts about dropping out, whereas the members of the   Development and impact interest   and the   Moderate interest   profile reported drop - out intentions more frequently (Table 4). The differences were statistically significant.

To   our knowledge, this is   the first study identifying doctoral students ’  individual interest profiles across two countries. We identified four distinct interest profiles among doctoral students. While all exhibited high levels of the developmental   interest , they varied especially in the weight given to   the   instrumental and research interest s . Two of the profiles exhibited consist- ently   a   high or moderate interest, while two profiles, namely   the   Development, research and impact interest  profile and   the   Development and impact interest   profile, indicated   a   low interest in the instrumental di- mension. In these two profiles, the developmental   interest was high .   Development and professional transformation have been identified   in earlier research   as central motives for undertaking   doctoral  studies   (Guerin et al., 2015; Skakni, 2018). The result on the developmental aspect of the willingness to refine one ́s intellectual skills while undertaking doctoral studies is   also   in line with current litera- ture (Skakni, 2018).  However,   the   two profiles   detected   differed in research interest. It appears that in the   Development, re- search and impact interest   profile,   there is a   strong commitment to conducting research and this entai ls  an inherent value for the students representing this profile. Prior research has identified   interest in  research itself as a core driver for those undertaking doctoral studies (Guerin et al., 2015; Neves,  2018; Pyhältö et al., 2019; Skakni, 2018; Stubb et al., 2012). The role of research may be more instru- mental for students representing the   Development and impact interest   profile. Research for these students may be more of a means to   an end , such as self - development or societal benefit,   rather than an activ- ity cherished in itself.  The study shows that students in   two   of the profiles   are more prone to considering   dropping out, one of them being the   Development and impact interest   profile. A lack of inherent interest in the research  itsel f appears to be an exposing factor for considerations to drop out. When the research is not pro- gressing according to plans or the process feels heavy, the research activity may not be sufficient to help individuals in this profile group to persevere   especi ally if achieving   the greater goal is not   yet   in sight . This result corroborate s   earlier research implying that interest in doctoral studies reveals associ- ation between scholarly and personal actions (Anttila et al., 2015; Sverdlik et al., 2018). Similarly, con-  sidering   dropping out   was also   more frequent in the   Moderate interest   profile, in which the members indicated overall lower scores on interest in doctoral studies than the other profiles. Individuals in the  Moderate interest   profile were also more prone to exhaustion and cynicism than other profiles. Prior  research   on doctoral students   (Cornér   et al., 2017; Peltonen   et al., 2017; Vekkaila et al., 2016) has identified a relationship between cynicism and dropping out. In light of this, it is not surprisi ng that

Page 11:
Cornér, Pyhältö, Peltonen, & Löfström  603  members of this profile   considered   dropping out of doctoral studies more frequently,   and also indi-  cated the highest level of burnout - related attributes. While research shows that a   strong interest in  research and developmental aspects appear to   be a   buffer against burnout ( see   also Pyhältö et al., 2019), it is noteworthy,   that in the   Moderate interest   profile the scores on the different interest dimen-  sions are b y no means low, only mo derate or   average. Individuals with the   Moderate interest profile   is  clearly more vulnerable to burnout than the other profiles. Understanding buffering factors may help to identify how students with this profile can be   supported at critical points in their progress. Some- times dropping out may be the best option, but this   should be preceded by thorough analysis of the situation and contributing factors and a reflective dialogue mapping out directions and solutions.   The  result emphasizes the importance of in terest in the   successful   doctoral   study career   (Forbrig, 2020; Grover, 2007; Lahenius, 2013). While it may be possible to complete prior study stages with lesser levels of interest, at the doctoral study level this is no longer possible. It is   important that aspiring  doctoral students are aware of this difference between prior studies and doctoral level studies and the expectations it poses on interest.  Our results confirm earlier research stating that   how   Ph.D.   students tackle their tasks and perform during their doctoral studies is partly reliant on their background and their personal motives for un- dertaking their study (Martinsuo & Turkulainen, 2011; Nummenmaa   et al., 2008). Advisors and su- pervisors are in a key position in ensuring that doctoral students begin their doctoral journey with a realistic understanding of the increasingly high demands and expected premises   for doctoral studies.  Research has emphasized the crucial role of the supervisor (Hunter & Divine, 2016; Martinsuo & Turkulainen, 2011) and his/her alertness and sensitivity of the Ph.D.   student (Gurr, 2001).  The profile structure does differ from the results in prior research (Pyhältö et al., 2019) on doctoral students ’   interest. Instead of three previously identified types, this study identified four profiles. The  Development and impact interest   profile   has not   previously been identified   in prior research , which may reflect the field of the respondents in this study. All respondents were doctoral students in the hu-  manities and the   social sciences.   E specially in social sciences, there is often a strong applied compo- nent making the proximity of these fields to societal relevance or impact closer than in some other fields   (Kyriacou & Coulthard, 2000; Löfström et al., 2010). To illustrate this, students who choose the field of education do so predominantly because they consider teaching to be a socially important job, and they hope to contribute to society and to children ’ s learning (Kyriacou & Coulthard, 2000; Löf- ström et al., 2010). The results showed that the Finnish and Danish students did not differ from each other with regards to profiles suggesting that the profiles are not socio - culturally dependent.   The  profiles are sufficiently robust to capture doctoral student interest across contexts. The result indi-  cates that   variation s   within contexts are greater than between the two national contexts.  The result in this study can be understood in terms of similarities in common cultural structures, a robust tradition in public higher education benefits (no tuition fees)   and   similar requirements for doctoral education (Andres et al., 2015;   Finnish   Ministry of Education and Culture, 2017; Gudmuns- son, 2008; Ministry of Higher Education and Science in Denmark, 2016).   Yet ,   our results   differ from the findings of Pyhältö   and her   colleagues (2019) showing several differences between Finnish, Span- ish, and UK Ph.D.   students interest profiles.   Prior research has established that doctoral student in- terest in doctoral studies is influenced by socio - cultural and contextual attributes (Lee, 2018; McAl- pine, 2017).   The   result s   of our study suggest that the individual ’s   interpretation   of the social and cul- tural characteristics of the study context   may   play a greater role in shaping the doctoral experience and related attributes than the socio - cultural context in itself. Simultaneously, research suggests that doctoral students may experience different challenges   that arise   from national differences in doctoral educati on and career options   (Pyhältö et al., 2019). Hence, it is possible that interest profiles are the same across the two national contexts investigated in this stu d y, but their underpinnings and premises are different. It is likely that a qualitative approach would shed more light on this question, and we  propose that there be   future research to investigate this.

Intere st, Burnout, and Drop - Out Intentions  594  Findings   The   interest profiles   identified among the   Ph.D.   students were the   High interest  profile , the   Moderate interest profile , the   Developmental, research and impact interest profile,  and the   Development and impact interest profile .   All interest profiles exhibited high levels of the developmental interest, however they varied especially in the weight given to instrumental and research interests. Ph.D.   students in   the   Moder- ate interest   p rofile showed s igns   of burnout,   and they were prone to consider dropping out. Also, individuals   in the   Development and impact interest profile   consid-  ered more frequently dropping out of their studies.  Recommendations  for Practitioners  Investing in the i dentif ication and support of interest among   Ph.D.   students is worthwhile ,   as interest is not a permanent   characteristic of the individual, and  the   combination of research, development,   and impact interest indicates a lower  risk for burnout and   drop- out inten t ions.  Recommendations  for Researchers  It is possible that interest profiles are the same across the two national contexts  investigated in this study, but their underpinnings and premises are different. It is likely that a qualitative approach would   shed more light on   these foci.  Impact on Soc iety   The results imply that   personal interest was not determined by the socio- cul-  tural differences between the countries, indicating that cultivating doctoral stu-  dents’ personal intere st, particularly   a   combination of research, development,  and impact ,   provides a potential buffer for doctoral students ’   burnout and  drop- out,   which has been raised as global concerns among policy makers, re-  searchers ,   and doctoral education developers and administrators during the past  decade .   The study has impact on doctoral studies in international communities.  Future Research   The   results in this   study   reflect specific characteristics of social sciences and  their applied nature. It remains for future research to investigate the extent to which the identified four profiles   of interest   in relation to burnout and drop -  out intentions   emerge in the natural sciences.  Keywords   d octoral education,   Ph.D.   students, interest profiles, burnout , drop- out inten-  tions, cross - cultural comparison  I   NTRODUCTION  Doctoral   students ’ interest in their   study is a core determinant of doctoral studies. It has   been shown to   play a major role   in doctoral   study success,   the   quality of the doctoral experience,   and   student   per- sistence   (Grover, 2007; Pyhältö   et al., 2019). High levels of interest have shown to be related to   re-  duced risk for dropping out   (Pyhältö et al., 2019), shorter study completion time (Lahenius, 2013), research career intentions (Forbrig, 2020;   Hermann   et al., 2014),   and   career trajectory (Grabowsky & Miller, 2015).   There is also tentative evidence that interest   is related   to doctoral students ’   study well - being   or lack of   it .   Interest in doctoral studies has   been shown to be associated to   having a joyful ex-  perience   (Wao & Onwuegbuzie, 2011) and   lower levels of experiencing exhaustion and cynicism (Py- hältö et al.,   2019).   In a   previous study on   Finnish   Ph.D.   students   in medicine , lack of interest   was shown to be related to   experiences of   poor atmosphere in the learnin g environment   and to stress  and exhaustion (Anttila   et al., 2015). This implies that personal interest may contribute to the stu-  dent’s risk   of developing study burnout.  There is limited research exploring individual variations in students ’   interest undertaking doctoral studies and scarce evidence of results on   the interrelation   between interest profiles and the risk for developing burnout and harbouring   drop- out intentions   in two comparable but distinct socio - cultural contexts.   Moreover, so   far the majority of prior studies on doctoral students ’ interest has been small  scale qualitative studies (Brailsford, 2010), and hence large - scale qualitative studies and measures to study on doctoral students ’ interest has been scarc e. The aim of   this study is to detect the interest

Cornér, Pyhältö, Peltonen, & Löfström  595  profiles for undertaking doctoral studies among Danish and Finnish doctoral students and whether differences between the two groups can be detected. The study also aims to investiga te how the pro-  files related to students ’   experiences of exhaustion,   cynicism, and drop - out intention.  L   ITERATURE   R   EVIEW  P ersonal interest   involves   both the emotions   related to the studies and   the importance   given   to them  (Pyhältö et al., 2019). Accordingly,   the interest encompasses both emotion-   and value -related   valence,  associated with   undertaking doctoral studies, such as involvement or stimulation a nd   the attribution of personal significance or importance   (see Hidi & Renniger, 2006; Krapp, 2002, 2005).   In this sense ,  the interest   in doctoral studies   reflects the alignment between the personal and scholarly activities  (Anttila et al., 2015; Sverdlik   et al., 2018.).   Earlier research   on doctoral students ’ personal interest has either been small- scale qualitative case studies   (Brailsford, 2010) or variable - based quantitative studies (Forbrig, 2020; Pyhältö et al., 2019). To our knowledge,   there   have been   no prior cross- country com-  parisons   applying the   person-centred approach on doctoral   student interest.   The obje ctive of a per-  son-centred approach is to “ identify subgroups within a sample of individuals that differ meaningfully with regard to complex systems of variables ” (Meyer   et al., 2013, p. 194)   and ,   hence ,   identify the kinds of interest -pro-  files doctoral student s   employ.   Scarce research on this topic   has resulted   in a   limited understanding  o f   the individual variation in   the interest   experienced in pursuing doctoral studies across different so-  cio- cultural contexts   and how such experience s are   related to doctoral student s’ risk   of developing burnout.   We take up the challenge by exploring individual variation s in   students undertaking   doctoral  studies   in   two comparable but distinct socio - cultural contexts, namely,   Finland and Denmark.  I NTEREST IN   D OCTORAL   S TUDIES  Prior   research has   shown that doctoral students start and carry out their doctoral studies for   a range  of intrinsic or extrinsic reasons (Brailsford, 2010). In fact, doctoral students may simultaneously en- tertain several complementary motives (Guerin   et al., 2015).   A s trong body of evidence implies that  docto ral students typically   are   driven by   intrinsic reason such as   curiosity to explore, understand,   and  create new knowledge, i.e.,   interest in research itself (Guerin et al., 2015;   Minis try of   Higher Educa-  tion   and Science in Den mark , 2016; Neves, 2018; Pyhältö et al., 2019;   Skakni, 2018;   Stubb   et al., 2012).   For example, in a recent large - scale UK survey,   41% of Ph.D.   students reported interest in  their research topic as the   main motive for pursuing a doctoral degree (Neves, 2018). Also, personal and professional transformation and development are often reported as reasons for undertaking   doc- toral work   (Guerin et al., 2015; Skakni, 2018). This includes the desire to refine   one’s   intellectual skills (Skakni, 2018).   M ore instrumental motive s ,   such as future job prospects after   completing the doctor- ate ,   have also   been identified   by Ph.D.   students.   For example,   almost one- third (31%) of the doctoral students   pointed out that their motive for pursuing a doctoral degree was to improve their career prospects (Neves, 2018). Accordingly, instrumental motives for undertaking   doctoral studies, such as  getting a better salar y   or promotions once the degree is completed are   also employed (Guerin   et al., 2015; Sakurai   et al., 2017;   Stubb et al., 2012).  Resent research   has   provid ed   tentative evidence on cross - country differences in doctoral students ’  interest.   A   recent variable -based cross- country comparison   identified   several differences between Spanish, Finnish, and UK doctoral students ’   interest (Pyhältö et al., 2019). While Spanish students sustained higher levels of researcher and instrumental interest compared to   either   UK   or   Finnish stu- dents, Finnish students displayed the lowest levels of instrumental interest, and UK students com- bined the lowest level of development interest with the highest level of cynicism. Further,   the inter- est was a determinant   of experiencing exhaustion, cynicism, study satisfaction,   and r eduction of   the  risk of abandonment across the three contexts   (Pyhältö et al., 2019).   Based on the findings,   it can be  presumed that differences between the Finnish and the Danish doctoral students in terms of interest may occur.

Cornér, Pyhältö, Peltonen, & Löfström  597  produce comparable numbers of Ph. D .   degrees annually (Ministry of Higher Education and Science  in Denmark , 2016).  In addition, doctoral education in both Finland and Denmark has undergone major changes in terms of a more competitive environment (Bengtsen, 2016; European University Association, 2019). This has involved establishing quality assurance and support systems (Andres et al., 2015), funding oppor- tunities (Ministry   of   Higher   Education   and   Science   in Denmark ,   2016; Pyhältö et al., 2015)   and in-  creased demands for international cooperation ( Finnish   Ministry of Education and Culture, 2017; Ministry   of   Higher   Education   and   Science   in Denmark ,   2016;   Toom & Pyhältö, 2020).   The countries  also share similar concerns regarding   doctoral education,   i ncluding high drop - out intentions rat es  (Cornér et al., 2017, 2018) and   the need to   build   a   more robust social support system for   Ph.D.   stu- dents (Hermann et al., 2014; The Technical University of Denma rk   (DTU), 2019; Vekkaila et al.,  2016).  Both in   Finland and Denmark, doctoral students are required to have obtained a M aster’s degree or  equivalent   in order to   continue to doctoral education ( Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture, 2016;   Ministry   of   Higher   Education   and   Science   in Denmark , 2013).   The   institutions decide   who is  to be admitted as Ph. D .   students   and the Research board of a doctoral school (Finland)   or the Ad-  mission committee in the Graduate school   (Denmark)   assesses the applications   ( Finnish   Ministry of Education and Culture, 2016 ;   Ministry   of   Higher   Education   and   Science   in   Denmark,   2013)   accord- ing to a   research plan.   The principal supervisor is appointed by the Research board of a doctoral school (in Finland) and the Graduate school (in Denmark). Also, co - supervision practices   are applied  in both countries.   In both Finland and in Denmark , a doctoral dissertation   can be completed either  in the form of a monograph or as an anthology,   meaning a   series of articles that includes a summary. In Finland, the article - based dissertation consists of three to five peer - reviewed journal articles   (de- pending on the discipline), and in Denmark   it   should consist of three to six   articles .  However, there are also differences between the countries (Kyvik & Tvede, 1998).   Danish doctoral  students in Humanities are required to include a long - term and continuous period   of research lasting two months (minimum)   at an active research environment outside their own institution (Aarhus   Uni-  versity, 2012). This is not required   in   the study programmes in   Finnish doctoral schools .   Doctoral ed-  ucation in the two countries   also   differ s   regarding funding for doctoral students:   full - time funding is usually provided for Danish doctoral stud ents ,   while in Finland funding is not automatically provided (Andres et al., 2015).  A IM AND   R   ESEARCH QUESTIONS  The aim   of this   research was   to explore   individual variation s   in doctoral students ’ interest in their doctoral   studies   in the   humanities and social sciences   in Denmark and Finland. We have explored the  interrelation between interest profiles and   the   risk for developing burnout and   harbo u ring drop- out intentions.   The following research questions were addressed:  1.   What interest profiles for undertaking doctoral studies can be detected among   Danish and  Finnish doctoral students?   Are there   differences in the interest profiles displayed by Danish and Finnish doctoral students?  2.   Are the   profiles related, and   how ,   to   students ’   experiences of exhaustion and cynicism, and  drop- out intention?  M   ETHODS P ARTICIPANTS  A total of 356   Danish and Finnish   doctoral students   from   one research- intensive university in Den- mark (n=145) and two research - intensive universities in Finland (n=211)   participated in the research .

R ESEARCH   E TH ICS  The research respects the fundamental principles of research integrity in the two countries (ALLEA,  2017;   Finnish   Advisory Board   on Research Integrity, 2012; Ministry of Higher Education and Sci- ence in Denmark, 2014). A study   like   this one,   that is conducted with healthy, voluntary adults and that does not pose risks or involve intervention in the physical integrity of the participants,   does not  require formal ethics review in either context ( Finnish   Advisory Board on Research Integrity, 2009; Ministry of Higher Education and Science in Denmark, 2014). Participation in the study was volun- tary and based on informed consent. The data are anonymous to protect the participants ’   identities. M EASURES  Data were collected using the   Cross-Cultural Doctoral Experience Survey   (Pyhältö, Stubb, & Lonka 2009; Pyhältö et al.,   2015).   The survey was validated with a pilot study,   which   includ ed   100 doctoral stu- dents in educational sciences, before the data collection.   In this article,   we report data   from   the   Inter- est in doctoral studies   and   Burnout   scales . The scale items and reliability coefficients (Cronbach ’ s Alpha) of th e scales are reported in T able 2.   The   Interest in doctoral studies   scale comprises of four   sub -scales  (15   items). These are   research interest   (3   items),   meaning curiosity to explore and create new  knowledge ;   instrumental interest   (4 items) ,   meaning   opportunity to cultivate one ́s professional skills  and knowledge ;   developmental   interest   (5 items),   meaning utilizing   the doctoral   degree and earlier studies as a mean to an end, such as getting   a better   salary   or promotion ; and   impact interest   (3 items),   meaning

Intere st, Burnout, and Drop - Out Intentions  604  C ONCLUSION  This study focused on advancing understanding of individual variation   among   356 Finnish and Dan-  ish   Ph.D.   students ’   interest in their doctoral studies and its ’   relation to experiences of burnout and  drop- out intentions in humanities and social sciences. The interest profiles identified among the Ph.D.   students were the   High interest profile , the   Moderate interest profile , the   Developmental, research and im- pact interest profile ,   and the   Development and impact interest profile . All interest profiles exhibited high levels of developmental interest, however they varied especially in the weight given to the instrumental and research interests. Ph.D.   students in   the   Moderate interest   profile   showed symptoms of burnout and they were prone to consider dropping out. Also, individuals in the   Development and impact interest   profile   con-  sidered more frequently dropping out of their studies.  The study highlights the need for further research into field - specific difference s . While our judge-  ment is that   the results reflect specific characteristics of social sciences and their applied nature, it re- mains for future research to investigate   the   extent   to which   the now identified four profiles emerge in  the   natural sciences. The   Moderate interest profile   warr ants further investigation. Understanding the deli- cate composition of various dimensions of interest may also help aspiring doctoral candidates and their potential supervisors to consider the premises for doing a doctorate. Finally, while this study has  co ntributed by identifying doctoral study interest profiles, it triggers the need to investigate the stabil- ity of individual profile membership over time. For this purpose, longitudinal studies   will be neces-  sary.   There are methodological limitations in the s tudy. The sample may not be representative of the population of doctoral students in the two countries. The reliabilities of two interest factors, namely Impact interest and Developmental interest were below .70, which can be considered to reflect ques-  tion able reliability (see Gliem & Gliem, 2003). These factors should be interpreted with caution, and they warrant refinement in further research. Furthermore, it is possible that students who struggle to maintain interest or feel stressed refrain from answering surveys as these may be experienced as an additional burden. This would give an over - optimistic view of interest levels in the profiles. It could even lead to failure to identify the most negatively disposed profile(s).
