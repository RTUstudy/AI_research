In fact, it can limit students’ future options, and it in -  volves a substantial cost for public budgets in most countries. This is not an easy  problem to solve, since student dropout is a complex decisional process involving  such factors as personal and contextual characteristics, educational variables, and  psychosocial aspects. Very few studies have examined whether sociodemographic  and psycho-educational variables affect educational dropout at different academic  levels. For this reason, the present study aims to provide a better understanding  of the role of several variables (age, academic results, gender, sexual orientation,  academic help-seeking, academic self-efficacy, and planning as a strategy to cope  with academic stress) in educational dropout thoughts in a sample of 759 students  resident in Spain (age:   M   =   22.91, 74.0% women). Regression analyses showed that  dropout thoughts were significantly predicted by academic results, planning, sexual  orientation, academic self-efficacy, and academic help-seeking. Agreements and  discrepancies with previous research are discussed. The results of the current study  can be used by educators, policy makers and institutions to develop programmes to  reduce student dropout by enhancing self-regulated learning strategies.

S. Martín-Arbós et al. 1   Introduction  Student dropout has become an issue of great interest in recent years due to its high  prevalence and impact on the personal and social context of students. In higher edu -  cation, student dropout levels are high in the European Union, and in some countries  are as high as 30% (Heublein   2014 ; Vossensteyn et al.,   2015 ). Its impact on face-to-  face and online studies is similar (Gonzales Lopez & Evaristo Chiyong,   2021 ). Policy  makers and higher education institutions should be concerned and take an active  interest in the problem, because finishing a university degree may help students to  overcome economic inequalities and reduce the gap between lower and higher socio -  economic contexts. In this respect, leaving university without finishing a degree is  one less opportunity for students to improve their life and adds uncertainty to their  future and life projects (Faas et al.,   2018 ). In addition, in European countries, higher  education is publicly funded to some extent or another so losing students during the  process is also an economic burden for governments and society (Guzmán Rincón et  al.,   2021 ). For these reasons, governments, institutions, and non-governmental orga -  nizations have been interested in identifying why students drop out of education so  that they can develop programmes that encourage them to complete their courses.  A great deal of previous research has focused on understanding the complex pro -  cess of student dropout, and has managed to identify, for example, the phases that  make up the process (see for example the model developed by Bäulke et al.,   2022 ),  the reasons for leaving education (e.g., Behr et al.,   2020 ), or the personal variables  associated with this decision (e.g., Jeno et al.,   2023 , Reisel & Brekke,   2010 ). The  current study focuses specifically on the personal variables affecting this decision, so  we will summarize the relevant literature on this issue.  1.1   Sociodemographic factors and dropout thoughts  Dropout thoughts are a complex process in which several types of personal vari -  ables (e.g., sociodemographic, academic, and psychosocial) play a role. For example,  among sociodemographic variables, the findings of studies on the association between  age and student dropout are inconsistent (O’Neill et al.,   2011 ). Being younger has  been related to less intention of dropping out in university students (Kehm et al.,  2020 ) and vocational training students (Böhn & Deutscher,   2022 ), but Pappas et al.  ( 2016 ) found no relationship between age and intention to drop out in computer sci -  ence students. Students of different ages have different life trajectories and experi -  ences (Behr et al.,   2020 ), which may partly explain the inconsistent results found in  these studies. For example, older students may have prior work experience in the  field, or other kinds of previous experience that motivate them to go on with their  studies. But at the same time they may have responsibilities (for example, children  or other family members) that make it difficult to attend the classes. The relation -  ship between gender and dropping out of education has also been studied and, again,  with results that depend on the field or the stage of the educational process (O’Neill  et al.,   2011 ). For instance, women studying science, technology, engineering, and  mathematics were more likely to drop out than men in the same field (Isphording &  Qendrai,   2019 ). On the other hand, one review found that men had a higher dropout 1   3  2080

Students’ thoughts about dropping out: Sociodemographic factors and... rate (Kehm et al.,   2020 ), Litalien & Guay, ( 2015 ) reported lower dropout rates among  female doctoral students. In terms of students’ origin, dropout rates can vary depend -  ing on the country of study. For example, in the United States of America, students  with a migrant background were more likely to drop out, whereas in Norway the  rate was no different than that of local students (Reisel & Brekke,   2010 ). It should  be considered that the social welfare measures implemented in some countries may  help to reduce social and economic inequalities among students, which could make a  difference to the dropout rates of some potentially vulnerable groups.  1.2   Academic factors and dropout thoughts  Previous research on academic variables shows that academic results– for exam -  ple Grade Point Average (GPA)– are important when explaining dropout intentions  (e.g., Belloc et al.,   2010 ; Bernardo et al.,   2019 ; Gairín et al.,   2014 ). Poor perfor -  mance could make students feel less motivated to follow their study programme and,  therefore, consider dropping out. Other educational aspects like the field of studies  have also been explored. University students from the fields of engineering and sci -  ences report more dropout intentions than students in other majors, according to the  research conducted in Spain and Finland (Korhonen & Rautopuro,   2019 ; Lassibille  & Navarro Gómez,   2008 ).  1.3   Psychosocial factors and dropout thoughts  Studies dropout has also been associated with psychosocial variables. For example,  a study conducted with 417 Portuguese university students linked dropout intention  to burnout in the academic context (Abreu Alves et al.,   2022 ). In addition, there is  evidence to suggest that using positive coping strategies, such as planning or positive  reframing, can reduce student burnout and decrease dropout (Marôco et al.,   2020 ). In  Norway, Jeno et al. ( 2023 ) found a negative relationship between dropout intentions  and perceived competence and autonomous motivation.  Other variables that have been the focus of research in recent years are those related  to self-regulated learning (SRL), that is, the process whereby students actively design  and manage their learning (Zimmerman,   2013 ). One of the most popular paradigms  explaining SRL is that proposed by Zimmerman ( 2000 ) which includes three cyclical  phases: (1) forethought, (2) performance, and (3) self-reflection. More specifically,  the forethought phase includes self-efficacy as a key element, the specific strate -  gies used in a task are part of the performance phase, and self-satisfaction and affect  belong to the self-reflection phase (Panadero & Alonso-Tapia,   2014 ).  In the context of this paradigm, some self-regulated learning strategies have been  related to student dropout intentions. One of these strategies is academic help-seek -  ing, which involves seeking assistance from other individuals (i.e., professors or  classmates) to achieve good results in the academic context (Karabenick & Berger,  2013 ). According to Schlusche et al. ( 2021 ), being able to seek help successfully  affected the intention to drop out and student satisfaction. Having assistance and  social support may play an important role in student dropout. Another study found 1   3  2081

Page 4:
S. Martín-Arbós et al. that having friends at the University could have a protective role because working  with peers can enhance learning and coping strategies (Morelli et al.,   2022 ).  A study of secondary education students in Chile(Sáez-Delgado et al.,   2021 ) found  that self-regulated study planning during the learning process also predicted a lower  dropout intention. However, the role of gender in self-regulated study planning strat -  egies should be taken into account. In fact, in the study by Bernardo et al. ( 2019 ),  men reported worse learning strategies than women, which involves worse self-reg -  ulated study planning. In turn, worse learning strategies have a negative impact on  academic performance, which may lead to thoughts of dropping out (Behr et al.,  2020 ). In addition, a meta-analysis of the relationship psychosocial and study skill  factors have with college outcomes showed a positive correlation between retention  and academic-related skills, academic self-efficacy, social support, and GPA (Rob -  bins et al.,   2004 ). Furthermore, SRL self-efficacy has been found to be negatively  related to dropout intentions (Morelli et al.,   2022 ).  From the evidence reported above, it seems that SRL strategies may play an  important role in student dropout. In fact, a failure in self-regulation processes could  be linked with difficulties in student attainment or academic achievement (Bernardo  et al.,   2019 ; Nota et al.,   2004 ), which is why it is recommendable to gather more  evidence on the topic.  1.4   The present study  The present study aims to better understand the role of sociodemographic, academic,  and psychosocial variables in student dropout thoughts in university students. It  also explores how differences between genders and sexual orientations can impact  dropout thoughts. These aims coincide with the American Psychological Associa -  tion’s resolution that recommends collecting this type of data whenever possible  and appropriate (APA,   2016 ). Considering the evidence presented above, we expect  older students to have a higher frequency of dropout thoughts, men to report higher  dropout thoughts than women, students in STEM fields to communicate more drop -  out thoughts than students in other fields, and local students to have similar dropout  thoughts to students with origins in other countries. Finally, we also hypothesize that  academic results, academic self-efficacy, academic help-seeking and planning as a  coping strategy for academic stress will predict thoughts about dropout.  While educational dropout has been widely studied from various perspectives,  this study focuses on a unique combination of sociodemographic and psychosocial  variables, especially in Spain. In fact, these variables have not been analysed together  in previous studies in this field. Of particular note is the inclusion of variables such  as sexual orientation and academic help-seeking, which have been insufficiently  explored in the existing literature. Although there are no previous studies about the  possible role of sexual orientation, we hypothesise that it will be a major predictor.  The results obtained by Severiens and ten Dam ( 2012 ) on gender showed that the  minority gender in an educational programme was more likely to drop out. Therefore,  we felt that minority sexual orientations might have the same effect. Furthermore, the  experiences of LGB students may be different from those of straight students during  their education, as they may fear being rejected or experience actual rejection by 1   3  2082

Students’ thoughts about dropping out: Sociodemographic factors and... peers. We believe that this situation may give rise to thoughts of dropping out, and  for this reason we expect to find higher levels of dropout thoughts in LGB students.  The current study is exploratory in nature and, rather than focusing on a spe -  cific model, it has features of a variety of theoretical models. This approach allows  for a comprehensive exploration of how different factors may influence dropout  intentions, particularly within the Spanish context. It also allows us to integrate an  underexplored variable such as sexual orientation, thus filling a gap in the literature.  Through this multifaceted approach, the study offers new insights into the complex  phenomenon of educational dropout.  2   Method  2.1   Participants  We recruited 813 students from different educational stages: 77.5% were bachelor’s  degree students, 15.7% were master’s degree students, 3.1% were vocational training  students, 2% were PhD students, and 1.6% were clinical psychology specialisation  students. However, considering the purposes of the current research, the study was  only conducted with 759 students from the following educational stages: bachelor’s  degree students (83.1%) and master’s degree students (16.9%). Their field of stud -  ies was heterogeneous: 39.5% were studying social sciences, 18.9% science, 17.6%  health sciences, 17.3% engineering and architecture, and, finally, 6.7% arts and  humanities.  The mean age was 22.91 (range   =   18–57,   SD   =   6.04). In terms of origin, 87.2% of  the participants had been born in Spain, and of those born in other countries, 84.7%  had been living in Spain for more than one year ( M   =   11.93,   SD   =   8.01). Participants  identified their gender as 74.0% women, 24.9% men, 0.8% non-binary or others, and  0.3% refused to answer the question. In terms of sexual orientation, the composition  was 70.8% straight, 19.5% bisexual, 7.5% gay or lesbian, 0.8% other orientations,  and 1.4% refused to answer the question.  2.2   Instruments  We collected data regarding age, gender, sexual orientation and country of origin,  current stage of studies, and the field of studies. Participants also had to provide  a self-assessment of their academic results on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (very  bad) to 5 (very good). We used a single item to measure the frequency with which  students think about dropping out. This item had four answer options, with the fol -  lowing labels: 1   =   never, 2   =   sometimes, 3   =   frequently, and 4   =   always. The mean and  standard deviation of this item were 1.78, and 0.69 respectively, and the coefficients  of skewness and kurtosis were both below 1 in absolute value: skewness   =   0.54, kur -  tosis   =   0.05. Furthermore, 36.1% of participants chose the first option, 51.4% the sec -  ond option, 11.3% the third option, and 1.2% the last option.  The Academic Help-Seeking Scale (Karabenick,   2003 ) was administered to assess  the tendency to seek academic help when needed. We used the Spanish version (Mar - 1   3  2083

Page 6:
S. Martín-Arbós et al. tín-Arbós et al.,   2023 ), which contains eight items on a Likert scale from 1 (com -  pletely disagree) to 5 (completely agree). People with higher scores on this scale  tend to ask for academic guidance when they need it (i.e. “If I were having trouble  understanding the material in this class I would ask someone who could help me  understand the general ideas”). In the Spanish population, the scale has proven to be  unidimensional. In the current study, the reliability of the scores on this scale was  Cronbach’s α   =   0.80, McDonald’s ω   =   0.81.  The scale of Specific Perceived Self-Efficacy of Academic Situations (EAPESA;  Palenzuela,   1983 ) was used to assess academic self-efficacy as perceived by students:  that is, to what extent students are confident they can perform academic tasks and  obtain positive results. The questionnaire contains ten items evaluating the construct  on a 4-point scale from 1 (never) to 4 (always). The following is an example of one  of the items on the scale: “I consider myself capable enough to successfully face any  academic task”. In our sample, the reliability of the scores on this scale was Cron -  bach’s α   =   0.91, McDondald’s ω   =   0.91.  The Coping scale of the academic stress questionnaire (A-CEA; Cabanach et  al.,   2010 ) contains 23 items that measure three strategies for coping with academic  stress: (1) positive re-evaluation, (2) seeking support and (3) planning. In this study,  we used the seven items of the planning subscale (i.e., “When faced with a problem -  atic situation, I make an action plan and follow it”). Higher scores on this scale are  indicative of an analytical and rational approach to the problem and the tendency to  develop and monitor an action plan. In the current study, Cronbach’s α for this scale  was 0.84, and McDonald’s ω was 0.85.  2.3   Procedure  The sampling was non-probabilistic for convenience, and the participants were  recruited through the institutional e-mail of their university and through students’  associations and social media. We obtained informed consent from all participants,  and they were informed about the voluntary participation in the study and the ano -  nymity and confidentiality of the data collected. We also provided an e-mail they  could write to for doubts or questions about the study. The ethical committee of the  institution validated the study design (CEIPSA-2021-TD-0025).  2.4   Data analysis  We first carried out correlation analysis, ANOVA and t-tests to determine which vari -  ables were related to dropout thoughts. Secondly, we carried out a regression analysis  to determine the contribution of each variable to the prediction of dropout thoughts.  We did not include in this regression analysis those variables that in the former  bivariate analyses (correlations, ANOVA and t-tests) were not significantly related  to dropout thoughts. In addition to standardized coefficients (beta weights), we used  the following indices to assess the relative importance of the predictors: Johnson’s  structural coefficients and relative weights (Johnson,   2000 ). It should be taken into  account that beta weights are context dependent and can become very unstable in the  presence of substantially correlated predictors (Johnson,   2000 ), and for this reason 1   3  2084

Page 9:
Students’ thoughts about dropping out: Sociodemographic factors and... We found no previous literature on dropout thoughts that included the variable  sexual orientation. However, the results of the current study suggest that this vari -  able should be included in future research, as we found that it led to significant dif -  ferences: that is, bisexual participants reported more thoughts of dropping out than  straight participants. Likewise, gay/lesbian participants also reported more dropout  thoughts than straight participants. As observed bySeveriens and ten Dam ( 2012 ) for  gender and described in the paragraph above, we can hypothesize that minority status  increases the likelihood of dropping out. The experiences of LGB students may be  different from those of straight students during their education: for example, they  may fear being rejected by peers, or actually experience rejection. It is important that  future research addresses this topic so that this phenomenon can be better understood  and specific action programs be implemented to prevent vulnerable students from  dropping out.  We did not find a relationship between students’ age and dropout thoughts. In  contrast, a study by Müller and Schneider ( 2013 ) revealed that dropout was more  likely in older students. Again, the characteristics of the sample may have a role in  explaining the different results.  In line with the results of Reisel and Brekke ( 2010 ) in Norway, there were no dif -  ferences in dropout intentions in migrant students. In our sample, students with other  origins have been living in Spain for several years, which can facilitate the inclusion  process. Also, the Spanish welfare system can reduce the difficulties that minority  students face and, therefore, reduce differences between them and students born in  the country. Regarding the current stage of studies, although the results obtained with  the ANOVA were significant, the effect size was very small, and the post-hoc tests did  not provide significant results. In addition, this variable did not play an important role  in predicting dropout thoughts in the regression analysis.  Among educational variables, the only one with a major role in dropout thoughts  was academic results. In fact, the results obtained in the regression analysis suggest  that it is the variable that contributes most to the prediction of dropout thoughts.  Therefore, this is a particularly important variable. According to Bernardo et al.  ( 2019 ), this variable is the main predictor of student dropout, which is consistent  with the results obtained in our study for dropout thoughts. The importance students  attach to their actual performance may be decisive in whether they want to quit their  studies or not.  Dropout thoughts were successfully predicted by the three psychosocial variables  included in the study, all three of which had a negative relationship. That is, higher  scores in academic self-efficacy, academic help-seeking, and planning as strategies  to cope with academic stress are related with fewer thoughts about dropping out.  Of these three variables, academic self-efficacy and planning had greater impact on  the prediction of dropout thoughts than academic help seeking. To sum up, using  strategies such as planning or seeking assistance to respond to academic difficul -  ties can help students to persist. Also, being confident about their skills has a posi -  tive effect on students’ persistence. As mentioned in the introduction, all these three  variables are included in the model of self-regulated learning proposed by Zimmer -  man ( 2000 ), which provides a framework that links their actions in a more complex  paradigm, and not only as individual variables. That is, variables such as academic 1   3  2087

Page 10:
S. Martín-Arbós et al. self-efficacy play an important role in determining students’ attitudes to academic  tasks and the goals they want to achieve which, in turn, may have an influence on  their general reaction to performing the task. During performance, students may use  a variety of strategies, and we have focused on academic help-seeking as one that  may improve task outcomes. After completing a particular task, students must deal  with any outcomes, which may or may not be what they expected. Being able to cope  effectively with stress allows students to adaptively react to the outcomes of their  task. In this study, we focused on planning as a way of coping with academic stress.  Therefore, by including these three variables in our study, we obtained an overview  of the importance of self-regulated learning on thoughts about dropping out. In this  way, our results contribute to increase the evidence suggesting that a better use of  self-regulated learning strategies can improve academic performance and prevent  dropout thoughts (de la Fuente-Arias,   2017 ; Karabenick & Berger,   2013 ; Nota et al.,  2004 ; Zimmerman,   2013 ). In addition, as reported above, the main predictor of drop -  out thoughts were academic results. Future research should address how the variables  involved in self-regulated learning can influence academic results, which would be  an indirect path to influencing dropout thoughts.  The findings from our study underscore the importance of addressing academic  self-efficacy, planning strategies, academic help-seeking behaviour, and the unique  challenges faced by students of diverse sexual orientations in the context of uni -  versity dropout intentions. By integrating these insights, it becomes evident that a  holistic approach is necessary to support student retention. Educational institutions  should consider enhancing their support structures to foster an environment in which  academic help-seeking is normalized and encouraged. This could involve the devel -  opment of comprehensive advising and mentoring programs that focus not only on  academic skills but also on emotional and social support, especially for minority  groups such as LGBTQ   +   students. By creating a supportive educational atmosphere  that acknowledges and addresses the diverse needs of its student body, universities  can make significant strides toward reducing dropout rates and promoting student  success. This approach not only has implications for the theoretical understanding of  dropout but also offers practical pathways for intervention and policy development  aimed at mitigating dropout rates and enhancing the overall educational experience.  The research does have some limitations. For example, we used a convenience  sample instead of a random sample. Even so, the sample was collected using several  procedures (institutional university e-mails, students’ associations, and social media),  so that the sample was as representative as possible. In addition, regression coeffi -  cients can be expected to be low because student dropout is a complex phenomenon  involving many different aspects, some of which are not included in this study (for  example, economic factors and learning strategies). They may also be influenced by  unexpected life experiences which are difficult to account for systematically in a sin -  gle research project. Further studies should be done to include economic and social  variables, learning strategies, etc., and acquire a more comprehensive understanding  of dropout intentions. Moreover, the study measured dropout thoughts in students  who were enrolled when the data were being collected. However, students who had  already dropped out were not part of our sample. For this reason, it would be neces -  sary to carry out further studies at the time of enrolment in order to identify at an 1   3  2088

Students’ thoughts about dropping out: Sociodemographic factors and... early stage those students who have doubts and are more likely to drop out. In addi -  tion, although thoughts are closely related to intentions and final behaviour (Bäulke  et al.,   2022 ), the final decision taken by students is beyond the limits of the current  study design. Another limitation of our study is the use of a single-item measure for  dropout thoughts. Because dropout thoughts are a narrow bandwidth variable, the  use of a multi-item measure could have led to a high redundancy of content, with  the problems that this entails (Ferrando & Morales-Vives,   2023 ). For this reason,  we decided to use only one item. However, we believe that further studies should be  carried out with a more complex measure of dropout thoughts that fully captures the  nuances of students’ intentions to discontinue their studies, and which, at the same  time, minimizes content redundancies. If developed, this instrument would be help -  ful to better understand the complexities of dropout intentions and their relationships  with other variables.  In conclusion, the results of this study provide useful insights for educators, pol -  icy makers and institutions. Understanding how sociodemographic, educational, and  psychosocial variables affect dropout thoughts can lead to intervention programmes  that focus on enhancing self-regulated learning strategies and take into account stu -  dents’ background, especially when they belong to a minority group.

Students’ thoughts about dropping out: Sociodemographic factors and... we also used these additional indices, which tend to be more stable than beta weights.  Johnson’s relative weights estimate the relative importance of predictors in contribut -  ing to a dependent variable, taking into account both its individual contribution and  its contribution when combined with other variables. These are presented as percent -  ages (i.e., they are divided by   R 2   and multiplied by 100).  We used IBM SPSS Statistics (version 28) and MIMR-Raw.sps (Lorenzo-Seva et  al.,   2010 ) to perform these analyses.  3   Results  Gender and sexual orientation differences were examined for student dropout  thoughts. Due to the number of participants in each group, we could only compare the  gender of men and women and the sexual orientation of straight, bisexual and gay/les -  bian participants. We found no gender differences in dropout thoughts,   t (749)   =   1.19,  p   = .23,   d   =   not applicable. We also tested gender differences in each field of studies  separately and found no significant differences (social sciences:   t (292)   =   1.62,   p   = .11,  d   =   not applicable; science:   t (135)   =   0.82,   p   = .42,   d   =   not applicable; health sciences:  t (126)   =   1.65,   p   = .10,   d   =   not applicable, engineering and architecture:   t (126)   =   0.33,  p   = .74,   d   =   not applicable, arts and humanities:   t (44)   =   0.92,   p   = .36,   d   =   not applicable).  However, we did find differences in terms of sexual orientation,   F (2, 739)   =   8.87,  p   < .001,   d   =   0.023. Scheffé’s post hoc test found that there was a significant difference  ( p   < .01) between straight ( M   =   1.71,   SD   =   0.67) and bisexual ( M   =   1.92,   SD   =   0.73) par -  ticipants, with bisexual participants presenting higher scores. Furthermore, gay/les -  bian participants reported more dropout thoughts ( M   =   2.00,   SD   =   0.67) than straight  participants ( p   = .01).  We also tested the differences in dropout thoughts between the fields of study,  and found no significant differences between them,   F (4, 736)   =   1.15,   p   = .33,   d   =   not  applicable. In addition, we explored differences in dropout thoughts by country of  origin, also finding no significant differences ( M Spain   =   1.78,   SD   =   0.69;   M Others   =   1.76,  SD   =   0.69;   t (757)   =   0.20,   p   = .84,   d   =   not applicable). Regarding the current stage of  studies, we found a significant difference between bachelor’s degree students and  master’s degree students,   t (757)   =   2.74,   p   < .01,   d   =   0.26, with bachelor’s degree stu -  dents reporting higher levels of dropout thoughts ( M   =   1.81,   SD   =   0.70) than master’s  degree students ( M   =   1.63,   SD   =   0.60), although the effect size was small.  Table   1   shows Pearson’s correlations between the variables. As can be seen, drop -  out thoughts are significantly correlated with academic performance, academic self-  efficacy and planning ( p   < .01 in all cases), but not with age.  Finally, we carried out a stepwise multiple regression analysis to determine the  contribution of each variable to the prediction of dropout thoughts. The variables  entered into the regression equation as potential predictors of dropout thoughts were  age, sexual orientation, current stage of studies, academic results, academic help  seeking, academic self-efficacy and planning strategy. The multiple regression equa -  tion was statistically significant   F (5, 753)   =   25.51,   p   < .001, Multiple   R   = .39,   d   =   0.15.  Table   2   shows the standardized regression coefficients (beta weights), the structure  coefficients and Johnson’s relative weights that were obtained. We found that all but 1   3  2085

S. Martín-Arbós et al. two variables (age and current stage of studies) were significant predictors of dropout  thoughts. 1   Regarding the relative contribution to Multiple   R   of each predictor, the  results suggest that academic results, academic self-efficacy, and planning strategy  are the major predictors, with academic results having the highest relative weight.  Although sexual orientation and academic help-seeking are also predictors of drop -  out thoughts, they are less important than the other three variables.  4   Discussion  With this study, we wanted to contribute to a better understanding of the phenom -  enon of student dropout, by analysing the influence of several variables on dropout  thoughts. Among sociodemographic variables, we found no significant gender dif -  ferences in thoughts about dropout. Previous studies have suggested that women are  less likely to drop out from university (Ghignoni,   2017 ; Kehm et al.,   2020 ), although  this could be related to the field of studies (Isphording & Qendrai,   2019 ). In this  regard, Severiens and ten Dam ( 2012 ) pointed out that male- or female-dominated  programmes showed different patterns, with the minority gender being more likely  to drop out. In our case, there were more female participants in all the fields of study,  and we found no gender differences when we tested each field separately.  1   To rule out that the response options of the dependent variable had been interpreted as categorical instead  of continuous, we also carried out a regression analysis with MPlus Version 8.10, defining this variable as  categorical. The results are equivalent to those explained for the regression with a continuous dependent  variable, with the same profile of significance for all the variables and a Multiple   R   of 0.42,   p   < .01,   d   =   0.18.  Therefore, treating this variable as ordinal or continuous does not noticeably affect the results.
