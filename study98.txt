This systematic review has analysed the present knowledge on  factors associated with school dropouts to identify psychological interventions for  promoting school wellbeing. A systematic search was done of the ScienceDirect, APA  PsycINFO, Emerald and Google Scholar electronic databases. A hand-search was also  done of the reference list of the included studies. The initial search resulted in 448 studies,  and the search of the references list of the considered studies resulted in 28 more articles.  The application of the eligibility criteria resulted in the inclusion of 38 studies in the review.  The study established several factors associated with school dropouts and social deviance,  such as school climate, school structure, and those defining social interaction among  students. Mental and emotional health was identified as the main factor influencing school  dropout and social deviance. A positive school climate should be the primary consideration  for promoting school wellbeing. School administrations, teachers, and parents should  collaborate to positively improve conditions in schools.  Keywords: wellbeing, school, dropout, deviance, addiction  INTRODUCTION  School completion rates have shown a marked improvement over much of the past century,  rising from single digits at the turn of the 20th century ( Ramsdal and Wynn, 2022 ). This  shift has been associated with educational changes such as the standards movement in education,  social activities and cultural changes. Nevertheless, the dropout problem has endured through  these changes, even amid higher school completion rates ( Dupéré et al., 2015 ). School dropout  has considerable consequences, including perverse implications on employment, lifetime earnings,  and health literacy. Students often fail to complete high school for complex reasons that  manifest earlier in their lifetimes ( Dupéré et   al., 2015 ;   Krane et al., 2016 ).  School dropout rates are linked to physical and mental problems, substance abuse, antisocial  behaviour, negative school attitudes, low quality of education, parenting problems and family  challenges ( Ramsdal and Wynn, 2021 ). These factors can be   shown to have an initial impact  on school wellbeing, which often leads to school dropout. Nevertheless, the uniqueness of  these factors necessitates a multifactorial approach for risk and needs assessment to promote  the creation of interventions aimed at mitigating school dropout ( Gubbels et   al., 2019 ).

Frontiers in Psychology   |   www.frontiersin.org   2   June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 914063  Limone and Toto   Strategies for School Well-Being  School dropouts self-report various reasons for leaving school,  yet these do not accurately construct the picture of the underlying  problem. It is usually difficult to establish a causal relationship  between any single factor and the decision to quit school 5.  However, preliminary studies have provided a framework that  delineates   the   factors   associated   with   students’   individual  characteristics and elements related to the institutional aspects  of their families, schools and communities ( Rumberger and  Lim, 2008 ). The latter category encompasses school wellbeing,  which is correlated to school dropout rates. According to   Doll  et al. (2013) , dropping out is the culmination of a much longer  process of leaving school, beginning long before the day that  a student eventually ceases attendance. However,   Doll et   al.  (2013)   identified a different framework for the analysis of factors  influencing dropping out of schools. The framework constitutes  push, pull and falling out elements, and while each type of  dropout antecedent has credence, pull factors demonstrated the  highest rates ( Bryk and Thum, 1989 ;   Doll et   al., 2013 ).  The key difference between push, pull and falling out factors  is agency. In push factors, the school is the agent whereby a  student is removed from school due to a consequence. In pull  factors,   the   student   is   the   agent,   such   that   attractions   or  distractions lure them out of school. In terms of falling out  elements, circumstances exist that neither the school nor the  student can remediate, and as a result, the connection students  have with school gradually diminish ( Doll et al., 2013 ). Dropping  out factors are associated with the characteristics of the individual  students—their educational performance, behaviours, attitudes  and backgrounds—as well as the characteristics of the families,  schools and communities where they live and go to school.  However,   Rumberger and Lim (2008)   determined that no single  factor can entirely explain a student’s decision to continue  school until graduation.  According to   Rumberger and Lim (2008) , dropouts have  higher rates of unemployment, lower earnings, poorer health  and higher rates of mortality, higher rates of criminal behaviour  and incarceration, as well as increased dependence on public  assistance compared to graduates. Still,   Drapela (2004)   established  that dropping out of high school has no substantive effect on  later drug use. This relationship was assessed with two fundamental  measures   of   association,   zero-order   correlations   and   partial  correlations. Deviant behaviours such as post-dropout drug use,  as measured by tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana consumption,  were shown to have statistically significant but non-substantive  relationships to dropping out among dropouts ( Croninger and  Lee, 2001 ;   Drapela, 2004 ). According to   Fernández-Suárez et al.  (2016) , alcohol abuse and substance use have direct consequences  on   individual   characteristics   related   to   deviant   behaviours.  Furthermore, significant dropout risk associated with poor mental  health   majorly   occurs   in   vocational   and   higher   education  ( Rumberger and Rotermund, 2012 ;   Hjorth et   al., 2016 ).  To address the dropout crisis requires a better understanding  of why students drop out; however, identifying the causes of  dropping out is extremely difficult ( Rumberger and Lim, 2008 ).  The dropout problem is considered a multifactorial phenomenon  resulting in an emphasis on and development of school-wide  multi-component interventions and strategies, mainly based  on school wellbeing research ( Johansson and Uhnoo, 2019 ).  School   wellbeing   constitutes   factors   relating   to   school  characteristics, the school as an organisation, the school climate  or culture, and the collaboration of professionals in the school.  These   factors   include   inadequate   or   inefficient   disciplinary  frameworks, poor academic climate and low school attachment,  and conflicts. According to   Gallup (2017) , a significant solution  to school dropping out would be   for governments to allocate  more   funds   to   districts   that   report   alarming   rates.   This  intervention would attract higher-quality teachers to the area  who, in turn, are better suited to motivate students to stay  in school and complete their education.  According to   Lee-St. John et al. (2018) , drop out intervention  strategies research should go beyond the typical school boundaries  to mitigate dropout risk factors. Still, schools cannot achieve  outreach independently and will require significant, meaningful  and effective partnerships with community agencies. However,  the barrier to research regarding dropout intervention strategies  is that many interventions that can be comprehensively evaluated  are narrow in focus and modest in scope. Moreover, complex  interventions that address the comprehensive needs of students  at risk of dropout can be   challenging to study ( Lee-St. John  et al., 2018 ). The purpose of this systematic review is to examine  the   current   state   of   knowledge   regarding   the   risk   factors  associated with school dropping out and deviant behaviours  and identify interventions used to prevent dropouts, as well  as their outcomes and effectiveness.  METHODS  Literature Search and Reporting  This research paper has been reported based on the Preferred  Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses  (PRISMA) 2009 guidelines. A systematic literature searches  until 27 March 2022 was carried out over multiple electronic  databases, including PubMed, Google Scholar, ScienceDirect  and CINAHL. A hand search of the reference lists of the  studies obtained in the initial search was also conducted to  maximise the scope of the data search. To ensure that the  most cited and recently published articles were obtained, results  on the first two pages of the databases were majorly considered.  A list of terms was formulated for the research questions, and  Boolean operators were used to group phrases and keywords.  The   following   keywords   were   used   in   the   search   process:  (“teacher-student relationship” OR “school wellbeing” OR “school  climate”   OR   “student   wellbeing”)   AND   (“dropout   OR  misbehaviour OR deviance OR defiance); all the sources were  published between 2000 and 2022.  Guidelines and Selection Criteria  To   select   relevant   studies,   several   inclusion   and   exclusion  criteria were formulated. The eligibility criteria were such that  they allowed the comprehensive examination of psychological  protocols   and   strategies   that   minimise   social   distress   and  promote school wellbeing, while ensuring the reporting of  quality findings. The studies also had to focus on the students’

Additionally, articles were also included if  they reported on correlated factors associated to a student or  a teacher. Consequently, studies were excluded if they did  not include as participants were students or teachers, and if  they did not empirically evaluate the relationships between  factors   in   the   school   environment,   dropout   and   social  deviant behaviours.  The titles of the articles obtained in the primary search  were   analysed   to   ensure   they   discussed   the   subject   under  consideration. Following this process, the included articles were  subjected to abstract screening, which resulted in the elimination  of more articles. The articles included after the title and abstract  screening needed to have answered the research questions.  Subsequently, the remaining articles were then subjected to a  full-text reading to examine their level of evidence and determine  their significance in this systematic review.  Assessment of Methodological Quality  The articles were subjected to methodological quality assessment  prior to the data extraction process; all the articles had to  pass the criteria to be   considered for data extraction. The  assessment items were clarity in stating the research question,  participant sampling method information, study design, data  collection   methods,   data   analysis,   study   limitations   and  comparison to the existing literature on the research topic.  The studies also had to compare study findings with existing  literature. Articles that comprehensively discussed these aspects  and followed the criteria were considered high quality.  Data Extraction and Synthesis  Data   from   studies   that   passed   the   eligibility   criteria   were  extracted into pre-defined descriptor tables. The tables collected  information related to the following aspects: author, year, study  design, number of participants, objective statement and study  findings. Research findings were examined using a reciprocal  translation approach and primarily involved considerations of  psychological   protocols   and/or   strategies   for   promoting  school wellbeing.  RESULTS  Search Results  The initial database search yielded 448 citations and reference  list search resulted in eight citations. The 244 articles that  remained after elimination of duplicates were subjected to title  and abstract screening. Finally, the application of the eligibility  criteria resulted in the inclusion of 38 articles .  SUMMARY OF RESULTS  Results were organised according to the main themes emerged  from the analysis of the included studies. Specifically, below  are reported the risk and protective factors that were found  leading to school dropout and social deviance in each article.  In addition to this, summary of results related to the interventions  found were reported below ( Tables 1 ,   2 ).  School Dropout  Studies that evaluated the risks of dropping out were   Temple  et   al. (2000) ,   Hess and Copeland (2001) ,   Lee and Burkam  (2003) ,   Christle et al. (2007) ,   Archambault et al. (2009) ,   Lessard  et   al. (2010) ,   Bergeron et   al. (2011) ,   Frostad et   al. (2014) ,  Austin et al. (2022)   and   Saleem et al. (2022) . Different studies  evaluated the effects of different school climate factors and  student characteristics on dropout risks.  Student–Teacher Relationships  Most studies found a negative association between student–  teacher relationships (STR) and the risk factor of dropping  out ( Lee and Burkam, 2003 ;   Murray and Malmgren, 2005 ;  Barile et   al., 2011 ;   Bergeron et   al., 2011 ;   Wang et   al., 2013 ;  Frostad et al., 2014 ;   Littlecott et al., 2019 ;   Song, 2021 ;   Zheng,  2021 ). This means that in schools where there is a positive  STR, there are low dropout rates. Some of the articles stated  that STR did not affect dropping out directly.   Lessard et   al.  (2010)   stated   that   STR   is   related   to   a   student’s   academic  achievement   and   satisfaction   levels,   which   are   in   turn   are  associated with dropout rates. Also, a study by   Wang et   al.  (2013)   stated that STR was able to reduce dropout rates by  mitigating the effects of negative peer pressure and conflicted  parent–child relationships. It does not matter whether STR  varies across school size and sector ( Lee and Burkam, 2003 ),  or if it has direct or indirect effects on dropout cases, what  matters is that by using this research, education stakeholders  can use STR as a measure of expected dropout rates. This  association is significant, such that research done on the intention  to leave came to the same conclusion ( Frostad et   al., 2014 ).  Lee and Burkam (2003)   also stated that positive relationships  with staff and administrators was equally impactful as STR.   Barile  et al. (2011)   went further and stated that evaluation of teachers  by students led to a positive STR climate.  Academic Curriculum and Student  Achievement  Students who achieved good levels of academic scores were  reported as less likely to drop out of schools ( Lee and Burkam,  2003 ;   Lessard et   al., 2010 ;   Cittone and Villani, 2019 ;   Hou  et al., 2021 ). To explain the cause and effect of academics on  dropout rates,   Lessard et   al. (2010)   associated an increase in  academic achievement to an increase in commitment by the  student. Dropout rates are not only affected by the academic  success of the student but also by the teaching curriculum  adapted by the school.   Lee and Burkam (2003)   found that  schools offering mathematics courses had 28% lower dropout  rates. The aim of the school curriculum should be   to keep  students ‘comfortably’ busy by not overstraining them but also  not giving them too much free time.  Another curriculum factor was the administering of preschool  education   to   students   ( Temple   et   al.,   2000 ).   Students   who

Page 4:
Limone and Toto   Strategies for School Well-Being Frontiers in Psychology   |   www.frontiersin.org   4   June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 914063  received pre-school education had a 24% less risk of dropping  out compared to those in the control group. The causal relation  is that preschool education reduces grade retention, frequent  school mobility and increases parental involvement.  School Structure and Organisation  Some of the school characteristics that were evaluated were  race composition, gender composition, school size and sector.  Christle et al. (2007)   and   Lee and Burkam (2003)   both found  that schools with a low-percentage of white students experienced  reduced rates of dropouts. The reason for this is not well-  known, but   Welsh (2001)   and   Gottfredson et   al. (2005) , on  the   other   hand,   agreed   that   schools   with   higher   ratios   of  African–American and Hispanic students had high levels of  misconduct. The level of misconduct was later on linked by  Archambault et   al. (2009)   and   Loukas et   al. (2010)   to levels  of dropout.  Schools with high, very high and low number of students  experience higher risks of child dropout ( Lee and Burkam,  2003 ;   Christle et al., 2007 ;   Marx et al., 2017 ;   Fu et al., 2022 ).  Even though   Christle et al. (2007)   stated a statistically insignificant  association, other reviews ( Prevatt and Kelly, 2003 ;   Christenson  and Thurlow, 2004 ) found a relationship between school size  and risks of dropping out. The reason given was that high  population negatively affects academic achievement, STRs and  social deviance for the students.  In analysing school structures, the issue of school policies  came up in   Barile et   al. (2011) ,   with policies like teacher  evaluation and rewarding teachers were evaluated.

Furthermore,  Lee and Burkam (2003)   reported that public schools faced  more dropout rates than private schools.  Student Emotional and Mental Health  Most governments in the world categorise education as a basic  need; however, some school factors may hinder this requirement.  The emotional and mental state of a student can be affected by  factors within or outside school. Emotional wellbeing was evaluated  in terms of school connectedness ( LaRusso et   al., 2007 ;   Loukas  et al., 2010 ;   Wang et al., 2013 ;   O’Reilly et al., 2018 ;   Piñeiro-Cossio  et al., 2021 ;   Tsukawaki and Imura, 2022 ), family relations ( Wang  et al., 2013 ), loneliness ( Frostad et al., 2014 ), and school engagement  ( Jimerson et al., 2003 ;   Archambault et   al., 2009 ). For example,  in assessing students’ frame of mind,   Archambault et al. (2009) ,  used three aspects of school engagements: a measure of how  much   students   liked   school,   and   affective   and   behavioural  engagement.   School   engagement   predicted   dropouts   with   a  statistically significant correlation ratio of 0.15.  Most researchers concluded that mental health was connected  to conduct problems, which were in turn connected to dropout  rates.   Hess   and   Copeland   (2001)   stated   that   students   who  sought   more   professional   psychiatric   help   had   a   positive  association with misbehaviour and were more likely to drop  out of school. Emotional stability is an important aspect of a  student’s wellbeing.  Student Misconduct  Most studies associated dropping out with the increase in  behaviour disorder ( Hess and Copeland, 2001 ;   Ryan and Patrick,  2001 ;   Welsh, 2001 ;   Gottfredson et   al., 2005 ;   Coetzee et   al.,  2022 ;   Fernandez   and   Benner,   2022 ).   There   was   significant  positive association between dropout rates and law violation,  suspension, and board violation rates ( Christle et   al., 2007 ).  In the study by   Hess and Copeland (2001) , the researchers  reported that students who showed high levels of stress had  equally high levels of disorderly and risky behaviour involvement,  and were more likely to drop out of school.  Social Deviance  There were a few studies that evaluated the causes behind  social   deviance   and   misbehaviour   in   schools,   presented   as  follows:   Hess and Copeland (2001) ;   Welsh (2001) ,   Gottfredson  TABLE 2   |   Continued  Author and year   Objective statement   Wellbeing factor   Theme  Chan et al., 2022   To assess the support students receive and the  perceived degree of wellbeing  Family, peer and school support   Support and wellbeing in school  Saleem et al., 2022   To assess the protective effect of racial-ethnic  socialisation on ethnicity-related stress  Ethnic-racial socialisation   Ethnic-racial socialisation to reduce  the negative effects of stress  related to ethnic differences  O’Donnell et al., 2022   To test a longitudinal model of promoting  confidence in adults and psychological wellbeing  among adolescents  Positive expectations from adults   Promotion of student welfare  through adult support  Austin et al., 2022   To evaluate the relationship between racial-ethnic  connectedness and behavioural and emotional  problems  Racial-ethnic connectedness   Effects of racial-ethnic  connectedness on the wellbeing of  African-American students  Coetzee et al., 2022   To evaluate the usefulness of mental health  programs for reducing symptoms of anxiety and  depression  Mental health programmes   Positive effects of mental health  programs on symptoms of anxiety  and depression in students  Fu et al., 2022   To study the relationship between social support,  self-efficacy and the perceived wellbeing of  teachers  Social support   Positive effects of social support on  well being  Salceda et al., 2022   To analyse the effects of a Dialogic Literary  Gatherings intervention on well-being and school  performance  Meetings literary dialogical   Dialogic Literary Gatherings  intervention to promote wellbeing  and academic achievement  Tsukawaki and Imura, 2022   To assess the type of humour that has positive  effects on students’ mental health  Teachers’ humour   The effect of teachers’ humour on  student wellbeing  Cittone and Villani, 2019   To allow the revision work carried out to identify the  positive effect of psychomotor intervention on  multiple areas of development  Psychomotor intervention   The positive effect of psychomotor  intervention on movement,  cognition and emotions  Song, 2021   To investigate the effects of teachers’ optimism  and effectiveness on student wellbeing  Optimism and effectiveness of  teachers  The effect of teachers’ optimism  and effectiveness on student  wellbeing  Zheng, 2021   To assess the importance of teacher support on  student wellbeing  Quality of the STR   The importance of teacher support  on student wellbeing  Hunter et al., 2022   To assess the effects of culturally rooted  afterschool programmes on students’ self-esteem,  resilience and cultural identity  Cultural rootedness of planned  afterschool programmes  The effect of culturally rooted  afterschool programmes on  students’ self-esteem, resilience  and cultural identity

Limone and Toto   Strategies for School Well-Being Frontiers in Psychology   |   www.frontiersin.org   7   June 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 914063  et   al. (2005) ,   Murray and Malmgren (2005) ,   Loukas et   al.  (2006 ,   2010) ,   LaRusso et   al. (2007) ,   Gobat et   al. (2021)   and  Chan et   al. (2022) . The reasons for behavioural problems in  schools are school climate, student characteristics, and emotional  and mental health of students.  School Climate  There are a lot of factors that define the school climate, as  illustrated by   Welsh (2001) ,   Gottfredson et   al. (2005) ,   Johns  et   al. (2019)   and   Hunter et   al. (2022) .   Tables 3 ,   4   show the  association between these factors and student behaviour deviance.  Some of the most important factors that led to social misbehaviour  are disrespect for student’s views and perspectives, unfairness  and lack of clarity in school rules, poor school administration,  poorly organised schools, high number of students, and lack  of morale by teachers ( Welsh, 2001 ;   Gottfredson et al., 2005 ).  The lack of morale, means that teachers are less involved with  students and do not teach out of passion and rather treat it  as a job.  Students’ Emotional and Mental Health  Students’ misconduct are mainly results of emotional and mental  issues. Issues like depressive traits ( LaRusso et al., 2007 ), feeling  of social isolation ( LaRusso et   al., 2007 ;   Loukas et   al., 2010 ),  lack of interest in schools ( Loukas et   al., 2006 ,   2010 ) and  high stress levels ( Hess and Copeland, 2001 ).  School-Based Student Behavioural  Characteristics  Apart from emotional issues, other student factors that promote  misbehaviour are increase in age, high student retention rate,  high ratio of African–American or Hispanic students, high  ratio of male students and students spending more time in  school activities ( Welsh, 2001 ;   Gottfredson et al., 2005 ;   O’Donnell  et al., 2022 ;   Salceda et al., 2022 ). When students spend more  time in non-academic activities, they have a lot of free time  to indulge in breaking rules ( Lee and Burkam, 2003 ).  Promoting Wellbeing in Schools  With regard to the interventions outlined in these studies,  Murray   and   Malmgren   (2005)   examine   the   effects   of   an  intervention aimed at increasing adolescent–teacher relationship,  finding an improvement of the STR.   Kelly et al. (2021)   investigated  the efficacy of a mentoring program based on psycho-spiritual  education and aimed at enhancing school wellbeing and school  climate. They found positive effects of psycho-spiritual education  on   school   wellbeing   and   perceived   school   climate.   Finally,  Temple   et   al.   (2000)   investigated   the   effects   of   students’  participation in the Chicago Child–Parent Centre and Expansion  Program on school dropout, finding a decrease in in problematic  behaviours and dropout rates.  DISCUSSION  School dropout could be defined as a multifactorial phenomenon  ( Johansson and Uhnoo, 2019 ) determined by several risk and  protective factors that can hinder or enhance students’ wellbeing  and academic performance ( Ramsdal and Wynn, 2022 ). The  main aim of this review was to identify these risk and protective  factors highlighted in literature to usually inform teachers,  parents, the general public and interventions that can foster  students’   school   engagement   reducing   drop   out   and   social  deviant behaviours.  From our results emerged that STR and students’ emotions  and mental health represents the main factors in predicting  students’ drop out and social deviant behaviours.  With regard to students’ emotions and mental health the  studies included in this review showed that the social wellbeing  of students has an effect on the student’s feelings of belonging  to school ( LaRusso et   al., 2007 ;   Frostad et   al., 2014 ). In this  regard, the social setting in a school should be able to mitigate  negative   emotions   like   feelings   of   incompetency,   lack   of  involvement and dislike of schooling life, and consequently  increase the commitment and interest to learn. In addition to  this,   Frostad et   al. (2014)   stated that loneliness, in contrast  to other factors like gender, teacher support and academic  TABLE 3   |   Show of associations between school climate, student characteristics and behaviour problems.

From this review has also emerged that a positive  school climate helps in mitigating the effect of negative family  life and peer pressure. If students do not feel comfortable in  school and at home, they are most likely to turn to friends  who will mislead them into misbehaviour. Schools are thus  responsible for the school crimes committed by their students;  if schools provide the right climate by creating a positive STR,  they   will   be   able   to   reduce   rates   of   students   engaged   in  misbehaviour and misconduct.  Psychosocial factors negatively intervene in enhancing the  relationships   between   dropouts   and   students’   difficulty   in  managing   educational   issues   ( Finn,   1989 ;   Kratochwill   and  Stoiber, 2000 ). Specifically, several studies on dropout, have  highlighted the importance of relationships in school dropout  processes   ( Ramsdal   et   al.,   2018 ).   Students   who   had   been  separated from their parents over longer periods of time, had  struggled to find friends in school, had not supportive teachers,  and had struggled with mental health issues reported higher  levels of dropout and social deviant behaviours. In particular,  positive teacher–child relationships were found to reduce the  association between early mental health problems and school  dropout ( Holen et   al., 2018 ). Relationships in general seem  to play an important role in school dropout. Teacher support  and   loneliness,   indeed,   predict   students’   intention   to   leave  school ( Frostad et   al., 2014 ).  Our review identified also other factors related to dropout  and social deviance such as school organisation and structure,  student individual characteristics and academic achievements.  However, according to research that has explored students’  perceptions about school dropout with qualitative interviews,  the main challenge of these students is represented by the  management of stress related to social situations associated  with   failure   and   humiliation   ( Ramsdal   and   Wynn,   2022 ).  According to literature, it seems that they lack the necessary  resources to cope with these social situation, and this contributed  to prolonged stress and failure to maintain their educational  goals (16, 17 and 29).  Finally, with regard to interventions outlined in the reviewed  studies several important points could be highlighted.   Murray  and   Malmgren   (2005)   recommended   that   teachers   should  be more involved with their students, while   Kelly et al. (2021)  recommended the enrolment of students into programmes  teaching   psycho-spiritual   principles   of   universal   mind,  consciousness and thought. They stated that the teachings  improved the student’s mental health.   Temple et   al. (2000)  recommended preschool education to teach students about  the importance of education and how to handle any education-  related issues. In addition to this, schools should improve  STR   by   establishing   medium-populated   schools   ( Lee   and  Burkam, 2003 ) and treating students equally, despite their  academic success ( Barile et   al., 2011 ). The teachers should  also be respectful to students and willing to regard a student’s  perspective   instead   of   harshly   discriminating   their   mental  capabilities. Some schools should also revaluate their school  curriculum to exert just the right amount of academic stress  on students. Social relations are an important part of any  person’s life, hence, schools should find a way of improving  positive peer interactions. For instance, low achievers should  stop being discriminated against, rather teachers should help  them in their area of interest, be   it music or arts. Schools  should   also   improve   the   psycho-social   climate   in   schools  ( Gottfredson   et   al.,   2005 ).   Professional   help   for   emotional  issues like stress and depression should be made readily available  at school. Furthermore, this review demonstrates that mental  health is important to a student’s wellbeing ( LaRusso et   al.,  2007 ;   Archambault et   al., 2009 ;   Loukas et   al., 2010 ;   Wang  et   al., 2013 ;   Frostad et   al., 2014 ); hence, the school should  provide readily available mental healthcare.  LIMITATIONS  The findings of this review should be   interpreted in light of  the limitations of our own work. Only assessed English-language  literature has been assessed and may, therefore, significant findings  reported in other languages have been overlooked. Although  an exhaustive search was conducted, a relevant search term  may have been omitted and consequently relevant studies may  have not been retrieved. Finally, although we attempted to screen  the retrieved studies thoroughly, it is possible that some salient  studies were overlooked. Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge,  this review is the first to systematically review predictors of  school dropout and deviant behaviours at school.  CONCLUSION AND IMPLICATIONS OF  THE STUDY  Just like any other part of life, education has its own challenges.  School wellbeing majorly impacts students’ dropout rates and  social deviance problems, with the causes being related to the  school climate, STR to a great extent, the school structure  and social interactions among students. Schools should know  that their environments have a huge impact on the student’s  mental health, hence if preventive measures fail, treatment  should be   readily available.  To date, no single effect of interventions aimed at increasing  school completion has been found to be   explained by one  TABLE 4   |   Show of associations between school climate and school disorders.
