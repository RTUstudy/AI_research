Cuza University of Iasi  Abstract  The aim of the study was to investigate the relationships between certain educational  strategies and students'   personality traits, on the one hand, and students' academic  performance, on the other, respectively between the latter and two types of outcomes  (i.e. students' academic performance and intentions to drop out of high school). These  relationships were exami ned in two educational settings: in the Diploma Programme  (DP),   a   two - year   college - preparatory   curriculum   offered   by   the   International  Baccalaureate (IB), an international private educational system, and the traditional  Romanian schools. A sample of IB stu dents in 3 Eastern and Central European  countries, and a comparison sample of non - IB students in Romania participated in the  research. Results reveal several educational strategies and personality traits among  those suggested by previous investigations tha t significantly sustain IB DP students’  academic   persistence.   Also,   IB   students’   academic   performance   and   dropout  intentions are influenced by these traits and educational strategies, and these effects  are fully or partially mediated by academic persistenc e. A different pattern of  associations emerged in the non - IB sample, with independent work style as the most  important determinant of academic persistence, suggesting that relative to the  traditional Romanian schools, the IB programme promotes a climate th at better  supports students in completing their education .

Ambas  relaciones fueron analizadas en diferentes entornos:   en el   Programa Diploma   (DP),  un currículo de dos años de   preparatorio   para la universidad ofrecido por   el  Bachillerato Internacional   (IB), un sistema educacional internacional privado, y las  escuelas tradicionales rumanas. Una mue s tra consta de estudiante s IB procedentes de  tres países de Europa del Este y Central y,   la   otra   muestra ,   para comparar, de  estudia n tes de Rumanía no pertenecientes a l   IB. Los resultados muestran que algunas  estrategias educativas y los rasgos de personalida d sugeridos por investigaciones  previas sostienen significativamente la persistencia académica de los estudiantes del  IB DP.   Asimismo , el rendimiento académico y las intenciones de abandono de los  estudiantes del IB están influenciados por estos rasgos y e strategias educativas,  efectos total o parcialmente mediados por la persistencia académica. En cuanto a la  muestra de no estudiantes de la IB, emerge un patrón diferente de asociaciones, siendo  un estilo de trabajo independiente el factor más determinante   en la persistencia  académica. Esto sugiere que, en comparación con las escuelas rumanas tradicionales,  el programa IB promueve un ambiente   que sostiene, de manera más exitosa, la  finalización de la educación de los estudiantes.

272   Holman et al. –   A cademic   P ersistence in the International  Baccalaureate  cademic   persistence represents a paramount concern for instructional  systems attempting to provide high graduation rates, together with  instilling the skills needed by students to succeed. Completing  secondary education is not only mandatory for ensuring access t o higher levels  of instruction and is responsible for several adjustment indicators. For  instance, its reverse phenomenon, dropout, is a predictor of future placement  problems and unemployment ( Rumberger   & Lamb, 2003 ). Ident ifying the  variables that explain and predict persistence and achievement is thus a high  stake for educational institutions and policy makers.  The main premise of our investigation is that participation in a specific  educational program   -   the International   Baccalaureate (IB)   -   may contribute  to the traits, skills and attitudes that allow students to persist in short -   and  long - term goals. Persistence is related to multiple achievement outcomes  ( Hardre   & Reeves, 2003 ;   Reason, 2003 ,   2009 ). Many authors maintain that  motivation affects the intention to persist in educational programs ( Astin,  1984 ;   Rumberger, 2006 ) and some mod els stress the need for an integrative  approach of the phenomenon. In this respect, educational psychologists tried  to   conceptually   articulate   integrative   and   comprehensive   models.   For  instance,   Tinto’s (1993)   model of student attr ition describes several factors  contributing to student departure, including the pre - enrolment attributes of  students (socio - demographic traits), family background, and prior schooling  experiences, in terms of both social adjustment and academic performanc e.  Understanding   who   leaves   school   and   why   is   necessary   for   creating  preventive school support mechanisms, since dropout is considered an  insidious, continuous process of disengagement ( Finn, 1989 ;   Rumbe rger,  2000 ), thus finding the levers of this process for deactivating them early is  crucial. Research has shown that dropout is associated to various factors, such  as low identification with school and feeling of belongingness ( Finn , 1989 ),  aggressiveness   ( Crain - Dorough,   2003 ),   substance   abuse   ( Freudenberg  &Ruglis, 2007 ), or truancy and discipline problems ( Rumberger, 2000 ).  Factors related to school   and teaching practices have also been diagnosed: low  level of teacher commitment or attendance ( Crain - Dorough, 2003 ), teaching  staff turnover ( Voicu, 2010 ), minimal support in transitional stages from   one  level to another ( Blue & Cook, 2004 ), teasing and bullying victimization  A

274   Holman et al. –   A cademic   P ersistence in the International  Baccalaureate  currently there are three schools in Bucharest that offer IB programmes,  including the DP.  Comparatively, the state - managed traditional Romanian school system  includes 12 grades, out of which the first 10 are mandatory. The high school  system , regulated by a distinct set of laws, includes grades 9 to 12, with no  demarcation between them, in contrast to the 2 - years IB DP enrolling students  in their final two years of high school. Students graduating from the 12   th   grade  are required to pass the   national baccalaureate examination, which represents  an important criterion in the admission to higher education institutions.  Around 700.000 students are currently enrolled in the high school state  system.  Particular to the IB Program are the   college - preparatory curricula and the  high academic standards ( VanTassel - Baska, 2003 ), reflected in the teachers’  continuous professional development and peer collaboration. Also central to  IB philosophy is the active promotion   of the stated values, namely the  educational objectives contained by the IB Learner Profile, which are  embedded   in   practices   and   visible   in   everyday   academic   experiences  ( International B accalaureate Organisation,   2012), among which the most  prominent are   the emphasis on intercultural understanding, critical thinking  and   active   citizenship.   Besides   the   active   promotion   of   these   mission  elements, the reputation of the IB Program consists in designing a system  based on the particularities of young learners th at is managing   -   despite  multiple challenges and elevated stress   -   to shape dedicated, balanced, and  academically prepared students ( Shaunessy et al., 2006 ). In this respect, some  studies indicate that following the IB DP contr ibutes to the formation of  cognitive and non - cognitive skills required for academic success ( Brunold -  Conesa 2010 ;   Wright & Lee, 2014 ). Also, the beneficiaries of the educational  program are allowed   to make academic choices and set learning goals  according to their interests, within a consistent instructional framework that  pays close attention to cross - discipline integration.  Holman et al. (2015 ) reported a qualitative inves tigation of the relevant IB  documents and the IB DP teachers’ perspective onthe educational strategies  through which the IB programme fosters students’ academic persistence and  on the personality traits that might contribute to IB students’ academic

Their results indicated ten strategies through which the IB DP  intends to foster academic persistence in its students, namely a) applicability  of knowledge, b) clear framework, c) independent work style, d) teachers’  involvement,   e)   focusing   on   the   student,   f)   intense   collaboration   and  partnership with the teachers, g) small class size, h) updated curricula, i)  comprehensive curricula, j) curricula focused on students’ real, practical  needs. Moreover, six personality traits were also assumed in the I B official  documents and by the IB DP teachers to be strongly related to academic  persistence and, consequently, targeted by the IB educational strategies,  namely proactive attitude, self - efficacy, mastery goals, academic resilience,  restraint and critical   thinking.  The present study   aimed to explore the actual relationships between these  two sets of factors (i.e. educational strategies and students’ personality traits)  and students’ academic performance, respectively two types of outcomes  (students’ academ ic performance and intentions to drop out of high school).  The first aim of the study was to identify, among the educational and  personality factors perceived as relevant by the IB representatives, those that  actually support academic persistence, in an IB   DP student sample from three  European countries. The second aim was to investigate the relations between  students’   traits,   IB   strategies,   academic   persistence   and   its   presumed  outcomes. In this respect, we hypothesized that academic persistence has a  medi ating role in the relationships between certain educational strategies (as  perceived by students) and personality traits, on the one hand, and certain  outcomes, namely academic persistence and dropout intentions.   The third aim  of our research was to explor e the differences between IB students and  equivalent non - IB students from regular Romanian schools   in what regards  the relationships between the variables under scrutiny (academic persistence,  its associated traits and educational mechanisms, and its relev ant educational  outcomes),thus examining whether the IB educational environment generates  a distinctive set of influences in this area in comparison to the traditional  Romanian school system.

276   Holman et al. –   A cademic   P ersistence in the International  Baccalaureate  Method  Participants  The study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the faculty  where the authors are affiliated, permissions for the study were obtained from  the schools’ authorities, and all participants gave written informed consent.  The questionnaire was distri buted to 554 high school students; 30 did not fill  in the items concerning the outcomes of academic persistence, hence they  were eliminated from the final sample. The final IB sample includes 226  students enrolled in the IB DP (141 or 62.4% females) in sch ools located in  three Eastern European countries (104 from Romania, 100 from Poland, and  22 from the Czech Republic). The final non - IB sample includes 328 students  (234 or 71.3% females) in the 11   th   and 12 th   grade in top - ranking Romanian  high schools. Part icipation in the research was voluntary; all students we  approached accepted to participate. All students were informed about the  purpose of the study and they were assured that no personal data would be  disclosed. Students completed the questionnaires in   their classroom, under the  supervision of a teacher.  The two samples (IB and non - IB) are comparable given the fact that  parental educational level is similar in the two samples; neither the difference  between the students in the IB sample and those in the   non - IB sample on the  mother’s   educational   level   (p=.42)   nor   the   difference   on   the   father’s  educational level (p=.57) are significant as indicated by the Mann - Whitney  test.  Measures  Educational strategies presumed to foster academic persistence . We  built short (3 - item) scales evaluating students’ perceptions concerning each of  the 10 aforementioned strategies, which required participants to estimate the  degree to which each strategy is reflected in their daily academic experience.  The items of t hese instruments were derived from the qualitative data reported  in Holman et al. (2015). The response scale for each instrument ranged from  1 = “strongly disagree” to 6 = “strongly agree”. For each scale, we computed

Page 9:
IJEP   –   International Journal of Educational Psychology, 8(3)   277  both   the   mean   inter - item   correlation   ( MIIC)   and   Cronbach’s   alpha   as  reliability indices. All scales showed satisfactory levels of reliability.  a.1.   Applicability of knowledge   (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.78; MIIC=.50)  refers to the degree to which the theoretical knowledge transmitted in school  is ap plied to practical issues; sample item: “We are often required to apply the  theoretical knowledge to various practical situations”.  a.2.   Clear framework   (Alpha Cronbach=0.57, MIIC=.30) refers to the  perceived transparency and clarity of obligations and res ponsibilities, tasks  and assignments of the evaluation system; sample item: “We always know  why we received a certain mark”.  a.3.   Independent work style   (Alpha Cronbach=0.59, MIIC=.23) regards  the presence of opportunities and encouragements offered by the   school to  develop and maintain independent work habits in their students; sample item:  “We are often assessed based on the projects we carry out independently”.  a.4.   Teachers’ involvement   (Alpha Cronbach=0.72; MIIC=.47) addresses  the perceptions on about   the degree of teacher engagement in the instructional  process; sample item: “I believe that teachers are not involved enough in our  education.”  a.5.   Focusing on the student ( Alpha Cronbach=0.51; MIIC=.50) refers to  the degree to which teachers take into co nsideration students’ needs and  preferences; sample item: “I would like to receive more guidance from my  teachers” –   reverse coded.  a.6.   Intense   collaboration   and   partnership   with   the   teachers   (Alpha  Cronbach=0.79; MIIC=.50) describes the general evaluation   of the quality of  the teachers - students relationship; sample item: “Teachers are a real support  for me”.  a.7.   Student class size   (Alpha Cronbach=0.44; MIIC=.20) measures the  views regarding the adequacy of class sizes for the achievement of educational  go als, or whether they should be adjusted in order to serve every student’s  needs appropriately; sample item: “During the courses, teachers always have  enough time to offer me further explanations or support when I need it”.  a.8.   Updated curricula ( Alpha Cro nbach=0.52; MIIC=.27) refers to the  novelty and appropriateness of the educational contents and technologies to  students needs and demands; sample item: “The topics we studystudy often  seem obsolete to me”   –   reverse coded.

278   Holman et al. –   A cademic   P ersistence in the International  Baccalaureate  a.9.   Comprehensive curricula   (Alp ha Cronbach=0.51; MIIC=.27) refers to  the broadness of the subjects and the degree to which they satisfy all the  knowledge demands of students; sample item: “The disciplines I study at  school cover my knowledge needs”.  a.10.   Curricula focused on the   real, practical needs of students   (Alpha  Cronbach=0.63; MIIC=.37) refers to the perceived applicability and utility of  the knowledge that the students usually attach to their academic work; sample  item: “The topics I study at school will be useful for me i n the future”.  Personality   traits   presumed   to   foster   academic   persistence.   We  selected from the traits revealed by the qualitative results a set of six traits  that, based on the literature, are assumed to be strongly related to academic  persistence. Then,   we identified in the scientific literature the optimal  previously validated instruments that evaluate these traits, as follows.  b1.   Proactive attitude scale   ( Schmitz &Schwarzer, 1999 ), an 8 - item scale  evaluating a factor with la rge implications for goal - directed behavior, namely  the dimension of ambition (academic goal setting and pursuit). The reliability  coefficients of the scale in the present sample were: Cronbach’s alpha = 0.69;  MIIC=.22.  b2.   General Self - Efficacy Scale   ( Schwarzer& Jerusalem, 1995 ), tapping  the dimension of self - confidence, evaluates broad positive beliefs in one’s  ability to manage difficulties and cope with challenges and stressful situations  (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.81; MIIC=.30).  b3.   Mastery Goals Scale from the Motivated Strategies for Learning  Questionnaire(MSLQ)   ( Pintrich et al., 1993 , validated also by   Daniels et al.,  2009 ),   tapping   the   dimension   of   self - development   academ ic   purposes,  orstudents’ tendency to choose goals and tasks in a way that allows them to  focus on growth and development of their skills (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.60;  MIIC=.34).  b4.   Academic resilience scale ( Martin & Marsh, 2006 )   is a 6 - item scale  measuring students’ ability to cope with stressors and school pressure,  enabling them to persist in achieving their academic goals (Cronbach’s alpha  = 0.81; MIIC=.42).

Page 11:
IJEP   –   International Journal of Educational Psychology, 8(3)   279  b5.   Critical Thinking scale from the Motivated Strategies for Learning  Questionnaire   ( Pintrich et al., 1993 ) represents a subset of 5 items from the  above - mentioned MSLQ that taps the higher order set of skills and strategies  employed in applying information and knowledge to new problems or   when  critically evaluating new concepts and ideas (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.76;  MIIC=.39).  b6 .   Restraint subscale from the Brief Self - Control Scale   ( Tangney et al.,  2004 , validated also by   Maloney et al., 2 012 ), is a 4 - item scale evaluating the  dimension of self - discipline or individual ability to resist temptations and not  succumb to momentary desires and impulses, in other words, to delay  gratification (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.50; MIIC=.20).  Academic persist ence   was addressed through a 4 - item scale we adapted  from the subscales   Degree Commitment, Institutional Commitment   and  Academic Consciousness   in the   College Persistence Questionnaire   ( Davidson  et al., 2009 ). Institutional commi tment measures the loyalty and trust the  student invests in the academic institution he or she is enrolled in, deriving  from the satisfaction with the choice to pursue that specific educational  program, while degree commitment refers to the importance or t he strength of  intentions to earn a degree. Academic Consciousness refers to the efforts the  student invests in academic work in respecting deadlines, participating in  school activities and completing required assignments (Cronbach’s alpha =  0.82; MIIC=.50 ).  Outcomes of academic persistence .   d1.   Academic performance   was  measured through students’ overall average grade on the previous semester,  which they were required to write in the questionnaire.  d2.   Intention to dropout scale   ( Hardre& Reeve, 2003 ) is composed of three  items focused on the present academic aspirations including future schooling  intentions, early indicators of persistence and dropout (Cronbach’s alpha =  0.79; MIIC=.50).  e. The set of item s covering participants’   socio - demographic characteristics:  gender, age, length of experience in the IB programs, grade, country of  residence,   parents’   level   of   education   (high   school/university/master  studies/PhD), ethnicity, nationality, and native langu age.

Page 13:
IJEP   –   International Journal of Educational Psychology, 8(3)   281  In order to assess the joint influence of the educational mechanisms   and  the psychological traits on academic persistence, we tested the model  including all the five predictors that emerged as significant from the previous  two analyses. We performed a hierarchical multiple regression analysis, also  controlling for age, clas s, parents’ educational level, country, years of IB  education and gender. In the regression model that already included the  control variables, we introduced at each step each of the five predictors (two  perceived educational mechanisms and three personalit y traits) in a fixed  order, to check whether they significantly increase the predictive power of the  model. The addition of four predictors (curricula focused on the real, practical  needs   of   students;   mastery   goals;   restraint;   and   general   self - efficacy)  si gnificantly improves the prediction power of the regression model (in all  four cases, the   F - change statistic was significant,   p < .05). In the case of the  fifth predictor (comprehensive curricula), its inclusion did not significantly  increase the percentage   of variability of academic persistence explained by  the model ( p = .45 for its   F - change).  To conclude, the joint statistical evaluation of both categories of factors   –  educational mechanisms and psychological traits   –   indicates that the strongest  predictor s of IB students’ academic persistence are: curricula focused on the  real, practical needs of students; mastery goals; restraint; and general self -  efficacy.   All   the   relationships   between   these   predictors   and   academic  persistence are positive, in the sense   that the higher the score on these  measures, the higher the level of academic persistence.  The   Mediation Effect   o f Academic Persistence   i n   t he Relationships  Between Educational Strategies   a nd Psychological Traits,   r espectively  Outcomes   i n   t he   IB   Sample  We performed separate sets of mediation analyses concerning each of the two  outcomes. In each set we used as predictors the four factors that emerged in  the previous analysis as the most important determinants of acade mic  persistence. In accordance with Baron and Kenny ( 1986 ), mediation is first  indicated   by   the   significant   relationships   between   the   three   variables  (predictor, outcome and mediator). Then, two regression analyses should be  perfor med, with the outcome as dependent variable: one that includes only the  respective predictor, and one including both the predictor and the presumed

Page 14:
282   Holman et al. –   A cademic   P ersistence in the International  Baccalaureate  mediator. Mediation is indicated by the reduction of the effect of the predictor  on the outcome when the med iator is included in the model.  Outcome 1: Academic performance (overall average grade on the  previous   semester) .   First,   we   examined   the   relationship   between   the  presumed mediator   -   academic persistence   -   and student’s overall average  grade, through line ar regression. Results show that academic persistence  significantly predicted the overall average grade ( β   = .23,   p <.01). Then, we  verified the effect of each of the four factors of academic persistence on the  overall average grade and the mediation effect   of academic persistence in  these relationships. Table 1 presents the standardized regression weights  resulted in the two regression analyses performed for each predictor, including  academic performance as criterion. It can be noticed that while all 4 pred ictors  are significantly associated to this outcome in the first analysis, two of them  (Curricula focused on the real, practical needs of students and Restraint) are  no longer significant in the second analysis (which also includes academic  persistence as   predictor). According to Baron & Kenny ( 1986 ), this pattern of  results   (the   lowering   of   predictive   power,   as   indicated   by   β – below  significance in the model with the addition of the mediator) indicates that the  influence of these pr edictors on the criterion (overall average grade) is fully  mediated by the mediator (academic persistence). In the other two cases,  results indicate partial mediation, since the respective predictors remain  significantly associated to the outcome even when   the mediator (academic  persistence) is added. Thus, these predictors (Mastery goals and General self -  efficacy) also exert other types of influence on the overall average grade  besides the effect mediated by academic persistence.

The relationship between the presumed  mediator   (academic   persistence)   and   students’   dropout   intentions   is  significant and negative ( β   =   - .41 , p <.001), showing that students with high  academic persistence are less likely to drop out of school. Table 2 presents the  main results of the two regression analysis perfo rmed in order to test the  mediating role of academic persistence in the influence of the four predictors  on dropout intentions. Results show that all these predictors are significantly  related to this outcome, and that in the case of two predictors (Master y goals  and Restraint) their influence is fully mediated by academic persistence, while  in the other two cases the latter only partially mediates their effect on dropout  intentions.

286   Holman et al. –   A cademic   P ersistence in the International  Baccalaureate  b.   proactive attitude   is not a significant predictor of drop out intentions ( β  = .01,   p= .07).  Discussion  The general objective of this study was to identify the IB instructional  approaches and the individual traits that support academic persistence, and to  examine their impact on two relevant academic outcomes, as well as the  mediating role of academic persis tence in this relationship. Wefound that the  IB instructional strategies highlighted by the IB documents and IB DP  teachers( Holman et al., 2015 )have a significant fostering effect on academic  persistence in the IB sample: students   with high levels of academic persistence  also tend to perceive their school as actively employing these educational  mechanisms. Next, we found that among the ten strategies under scrutiny, the  curricula focused on the real, practical needs of students has   the greatest  impact on academic persistence. Promoting civic engagement, curiosity,  initiative and deep action learning has been previously shown to have an  important impact on commitment in difficult tasks ( Allen, 2011 ). Making t he  practical use of knowledge salient, establishing the associations between  concepts, explanations and real life facts is strengthening commitment to  learning. When students work to acquire knowledge and skills that they  perceive as relevant, they are mor e persistent in their academic endeavors  ( Eccles et al., 1983 ). Also important are the links between the academic  contents   and   the   personal   interests   and   values   of   the   learner,   this  correspondence leading to enhanced academic perf ormance ( Hulleman   &  Harackiewicz,   2009 ).   On   the   other   hand,   inadequate   curricula   and  instructional practices, coupled with lack for support in transitional stages  from a level to another ( Blue & Cook, 200 4 ), and poor school practices and  policies ( Rumberger, 2000 ) predispose students to dropout.  We also found that the students’ individual traits that we tested in  relationship with academic persistence (i.e. proactive attitude,   self - efficacy,  mastery   goals,   academic   resilience,   critical   thinking,   and   restraint)   are  significantly associated with academic persistence in the IB sample. Further  analysis revealed that three traits that have the strongest effect on academic

Page 19:

Mastery goals  refer to students’ tendency to choose goals and tasks in a way that allows them  to focus on growth and development of their skills, not only achieving formal  acknowledgment and rewards fo r their work ( Pintrich et al., 1993 ;   Daniels et  al., 2009 ). Our results show that students oriented towards self - development,  who approach learning situations as opportunities and, thus, perceive their  educational efforts as investments towards mastery goals, have higher levels  of academic persistence, in line with the dominant conceptualizations of this  type of motivation ( Harter, 1978 ). Restraint reflects the students’ capaci ty to  engage in long term tasks by avoiding being sidetracked by momentary  distractions and temptations, with minimum adult supervision ( Tangney,  Baumeister, & Boone, 2004 ). As the learning process frequently requires the  capacity to delay immediate gratification, exercising effortful self - control in  avoiding temptation predicts higher test scores ( Mischel, 2014 ). Previous  results also show that conscientiousness, a related trait, is a predictor o f effort  across disciplines and achievement, such as GPA ( Noftle   & Robins, 2007 ).  General self - efficacy covers the beliefs and confidence in the ability to face  difficult and challenging tasks ( Schwarz er& Jerusalem, 1995 ). Its positive  connection with self - confidence and self - efficacy beliefs has been frequently  reported in the educational literature ( Brown et al . , 2008 ). Such beliefs predict  the   effort   invested   in   academic   acti vities   and,   consequently,   students’  persistence ( Trautwein, et al., 2009 ).  The importance of academic persistence among the educational effects of  the IB programme has also been highlighted by previous studies, although  only at an implicit level. For instance,   Wright (2014 ), in a synthetic overview  of   the long term outcomes of the IB programmes, shows that their mission and  instruction focus on enhancing people with an integrated personal system of  social values and dispositional orientations that ensure long - lasting effects in  their life by becoming l ifelong learners. Our study reveals some of the actual  mechanisms of those effects, as well as the role of academic persistence and  the educational strategies that can enhance it.  Concerning the relationships between the components of the IB DP, the  indivi dual traits, academic persistence and its outcomes, results show that IB  DP students’ academic performance and intention to dropout are related to the  traits and educational strategies under consideration, and that these effects are

Page 20:
288   Holman et al. –   A cademic   P ersistence in the International  Baccalaureate  fully or partially medi ated by academic persistence. Students with intense  mastery goals, who also believe in their abilities to successfully overcome  academic obstacles and attain their objectives, and who are able to engage in  effortful restrained behaviors and delay gratifica tion are those with high  academic   persistence.   Furthermore,   their   commitment   leads   to   higher  academic performance and lower intentions to drop out. A similar influence  on the two outcomes is that exerted by the perception of the curricula as  focused on the   real practical needs of the student, an effect that is also  mediated by academic persistence. Previous investigations revealed the  importance of some of these dimensions in the educational setting; for  instance, general self - efficacy was shown to have a p otentially preventive role  in academic dropout ( Shannon &   Bylsma, 2005 ), while other studies have  concluded that personal beliefs about one`s capabilities of succeeding can  explain educational outcomes ( Z ajacova, Lynch, &Espenshade, 2005 ). Our  results add more depth to the understanding of to these relationships by  revealing that they are at least partially mediated by academic persistence,  thus pinpointing one of the psychological mechanisms of these e ffects: the  aforementioned psychological and educational variables foster students’  academic persistence, which in turn are associated with more positive  educational outcomes.  Our final research question refers to the comparison between IB students  and eq uivalent non - IB students in Romanian schools in what regards the  relationships of academic persistence and its associated traits and educational  strategies with the relevant educational outcomes. We found that the effects  of the educational strategies on s tudents’ academic persistence are weaker  than in the IB environment. Thestrategy that emerged as having the strongest  effect on non - IB students’ academic persistence is independent work style. In  the Romanian educational system, students seem to be most pe rsistent when  they are encouraged to work on their own, when their success or failure is  contingent only on their own work. Several authors state that students need an  environment in which they do not feel controlled but are stimulated to work  freely ( Kohn, 2011 ). However, the primary use of this strategy, to the  detriment of others, may lead to long term negative effects such as low school  engagement, associated with decreased academic persistence ( Applet on,

Page 21:
IJEP   –   International Journal of Educational Psychology, 8(3)   289  Christenson & Furlong, 2008 ). Moreover, previous studies have shown that  students’ academic persistence is best stimulated through a synergy of school  strategies. For instance, in a meta - analysis of over 800 papers,   Hattie ( 2013 )  underlines the importance of classroom size and management, teacher - student  relationships, teacher’s specific teaching strategies and curricula on students’  educational achievement.  Similarly,   as   opposed   to   the   IB   students,   in   which   all   individual  ps ychological traits analyzed were found to be associated with academic  persistence,   in   the   non - IB   students   only   four   such   associations   were  significant.   Critical   thinking   and   restraint,   which   are   among   the   most  important individual personality traits associ ated with increased academic  persistence in the IB group, did not correlate with academic persistence in the  non - IB group. This finding is also in accordance with previous studies that  have found that the Romanian traditional school system lacks the means   to  encourage student’s curiosity and mostly rewards memorization ( Nita, 2013 ).  In such a context that discourages students’ originality and values the exact  reproduction of learnt material, the students’ academic persistence seems t o  be associated with other personality traits. Specifically, as our result show,  non - IB students’ academic persistence is most associated with their proactive  attitude. Students with a proactive attitude have a sense of control over their  education and bel ieve that they are solely responsible for their success or  failure. They prefer to work independently, setting their own goals, and they  believe that school has limited influence on their future ( Harvey, Blouin   &  Stout, 2006 ). It   seems that, in the context of a traditional educational system  that still overuses coercive measures, and does not support students’ creativity  and where students’ perceive their teachers as being disengaged ( Nita, 2013 ),  the most p ersistent are those students who are used to work on their own and  who believe that they are solely responsible for their education and future.  In our mediation analyses, we found that the only educational strategy  associated with non - IB students’ academi c performance was independent  work   style   and   this   relationship   was   mediated   by   students’   academic  persistence. This result further suggests that the students who have the  capacity to work on their own and develop various skills independently are  the ones m ost likely to thrive in the Romanian public schools. On the other  hand, students’ proactive attitudes, although significantly predicting their

Page 22:
290   Holman et al. –   A cademic   P ersistence in the International  Baccalaureate  academic persistence, have no further effect on their academic performance,  a result suggesting the traditional e ducational system does not reward  proactive   individuals.   Somehow   paradoxically,   the   most   academically  persistent non - IB students also tend to have the most proactive attitudes, but  this attitude doesn’t translate into higher school grades. This pattern of   results  suggests that the Romanian traditional school system is not consciously  assuming   the   mission   of   developing   students’   proactivity,   since   this  psychological trait is not externally reinforced through higher grades.  The generalizability of our finding s is limited by the fact that we only used  Romanian students as a control group; further studies could test the cultural  variability of these effects by comparing IB students to non - IB students  enrolled in traditional school systems in other countries. Ove rall, our results  show that the IB DP programme fosters students’ academic persistence to a  higher degree than the traditional educational system (at least the Romanian  one) does. This effect is mostly due to a set of distinct strategies that stimulate  thi s trait both directly and indirectly, especially through the development of  certain psychological skills supporting academic persistence, as well as  through its curricula.  To   conclude,   our   results   suggest   that   IB   DP   students’   academic  performance and inte ntion to dropout are associated to a complex set of  educational strategies promoted in this environment, especially the curricula  focused on the real, practical needs of students, as well as to certain  personality traits, among which students’ mastery goal s, restraint and general  self - efficacy were found to be especially conducive to academic performance.  Moreover, these influences of the two types of factors on the two academic  outcomes, i.e. performance and dropout intentions, were fully or partially  medi ated by academic persistence. The pattern of relationships that emerged  in the traditional Romanian schools is quite different, with fewer significant  relationships between these dimensions and with independent work style as  the sole educational strategy i nfluencing students’ academic persistence and  its consecutive outcomes. Thus, our findings could be relevant in providing  specific guidelines in the process of designing educational policies and  strategies. Among others, they suggest that the traditional R omanian school  system would strengthen the support they offer to students’ academic

Other structural characteristics of the  institutions, such as the magnitude of schools an d classes, reflected in student -  teacher   ratios   ( Andrei,   Profiroiu,   Profiroiu,   &   Iacob,   2011 ),   deficient  evaluation systems ( Govindaraju   &   Venkatesan, 2010 ), or bureaucratized and  rigid structures and   policies ( Angus &   Mirel, 1999 ), seem to be other factors  determining low attrition rates.  Positive effects on persistence have been shown by higher budgetary  allocation   to   student   services,   low   student - teacher   ratio   ( Chen,   2012 ),  perceived institutional support for all demands of the students, including  social   and   emotional   needs   ( LanRong   &   Preissle,   2009 ),   support   and  encouragement offered by teachers ( Hu & M a, 2010 ), practicing active  teaching pedagogies ( Braxton, Bray& Berger, 2000 ), promoting positive  attitudes, such as civic engagement, curiosity, initiative, deep action learning  ( Allen, 2011 ), and   fostering a culture of collaboration, open dialogue,  teamwork and constructive debate ( AlKandari, 2012 ).  Pre - enrolment attributes have gained preferential attention, with focus on  personality factors that act as advantages, na mely the malleable ones, which  can add to fostering the right type of academic motivation. Among these,  scholars have highlighted the following: self - efficacy beliefs ( Zimmerman,  Bandura&   Martinez - Pons,   1992 ),   ability   beliefs   o r   growth   mindsets  ( Blackwell, Trzesniewski, &Dweck, 2007 ), academic engagement ( Fredricks,  Blumenfeld, & Paris, 2004 ), autonomous academic motivation ( Deci& Ryan,  1987 ), stud ent engagement ( Martin, 2007 ), academic resilience (Alva, 1991),  willful self - control, tenacity and grit ( Duckworth, Peterson, Matthews, &  Kelly, 2007 ).  The International Baccalaureate   E ducational   S ystem  The   International   Baccalaureate   Organization   (IBO)   is   an   international  educational foundation. In 2014, it reported almost 5,500 programs offered in  more than 4,000 schools around the world. The IBO offers four educational  programmes, one of which   is the Diploma Programme (DP) for students aged  16 to 19 years. The IB DP represents a two - year pre - university curriculum  leading to a qualification welcomed by leading universities around the world.  (IBO, 2013). In Romania, the program has been implemente d since 1997;

The actual correlations of each mechanism were: applicability of  knowledge:   r =.34,   p <.01 , clear framework:   r =.29,   p <.01, independent work  style:   r =.29,   p <.01, teachers’ involvement:   r =.23,   p <.01, focusing on the  student:   r =.19,   p <.01, intense collaboration and partnership with the teachers:  r =.29,   p <.01,   students   class   size:   r =.34,   p= .06,   upd ated   curricula:  r =.30, p <.01, comprehensive curricula:   r =.39,   p <.01, curricula focused on the  real, practical needs of students:   r =.46,   p <.01.  Second, we introduced students’ scores concerning their perceptions of the  educational mechanisms as predictors in   a multiple stepwise regression  analysis (with academic persistence as criterion) in order to determine those  with the strongest relationship to this variable. The regression model was  significant (F(2,223) = 32.21,   p   < .001), with two significant predicto rs:  curricula focused on the real, practical needs of students ( β   = .35, p<.001), and  comprehensive curricula ( β   = .16, p<.05).  Personality   Traits Significantly Associated   t o Academic Persistence   i n  t he   IB   Sample  All   six   traits   are   significantly   and   positively   correlated   to   academic  persistence: general self - efficacy:   r =.39,   p <.01; proactive attitude:   r =.34,  p <.01; academic resilience:   r =.33,   p <.01; critical thinking:   r =.30,   p <.01;  mastery goals:   r =.40,   p <.01; rest raint:   r =.34,   p <.01.  Second, we introduced the 7 traits as predictors in a multiple stepwise  regression analysis (with academic persistence as criterion) in order to  determine those with the strongest influence on this variable. The regression  model was si gnificant (F(3,222) = 27.24,   p   < .001) and included three  significant predictors: mastery goals ( β   = .28, p<.001), restraint ( β   = .22,  p<.001) and general self - efficacy ( β   = .22, p<.01).

Then, we identified the strongest predict ors of  academic persistence in this group of educational mechanisms through a  multiple stepwise regression. The regression model was significant (F(1,326)  = 30.18,   p < .001) and included only one significant predictor: independent  work style ( β   = .29,   p <.00 1).

IJEP   –   International Journal of Educational Psychology, 8(3)   285  Personality   Traits Significantly Associated   t o Academic Persistence   in  the non - IB   S ample  In the non - IB sample, four traits are significantly correlated to academic  persistence: general self - efficacy:   r =.32;   p <.01; proactive attitude:   r =.36;  p <.01; academic resilience:   r =.23;   p <.01; mastery goals:   r =.20;   p <.01. In the  multiple regression analys is performed in order to identify the strongest  predictors of academic persistence in this category, a significant regression  model emerged (F(1,326) = 48.51,   p   < .001) which included only one  predictor: proactive attitude ( β   = .36, p<.001).  The   Mediation   Effect   o f Academic Persistence   i n   t he Relationships  Between Educational Strategies   a nd Psychological Traits, Respectively  Outcomes   i n   t he   n on - IB   Sample  Outcome 1: Academic performance.   The relationship between the  presumed mediator (academic   persistence) and the overall average grade is  significant and positive ( β   = .16 , p <.01). Then, we verified the effect of each  of the two factors of academic persistence found in the non - IB sample on the  overall average grade and the mediation effect of aca demic persistence in  these relationships.  a.   independent work style   significantly predicts the overall average grade  ( β   = .15, p<.01). In the model including both this predictor and the presumed  mediator, both factors emerged as significantly predicting th e overall average  grade: academic persistence ( β   = .13,   p <.05) and independent work style ( β   =  .12,   p <.05), indicating that the effect of this educational mechanism on the  overall average grade is partially mediated by academic persistence.  b.   proactive at titude   is not a significant predictor of the overall average  grade( β   = .05,   p= .33).  Outcome 2. Dropout intentions .   The relationship between the presumed  mediator   (academic   persistence)   and   student’s   dropout   intentions   is  significant and negative, high a cademic persistence significantly predicting  low levels of dropout intentions ( β   =   - .30 , p <.001).  a.   independent work style   is not a significant predictor of dropout intentions  ( β   =   - .06,   p= .28).
