Together with personal and  social factors, issues associated with the quality of teaching provided by universities  determine students’ decision to persist in pursuing their academic degree or, on the  contrary, to drop out of university studies. Our working hypothesis is that the impact  on improving the quality of teaching by considering pedagogical factors which  are currently being researched and experimented with, can improve the overall  persistence rate by reducing the dropout rate. Our work consisted of applying an  instrument designed to diagnose the risk of dropping out of university studies to a  sample of first-year university students at the University of Granada. The instrument  was applied at the beginning of the second semester. Of the 642 pupils surveyed, we  established a risk group of 20 students. In this preliminary study we intend to make a  first approach to the phenomenon of academic failure in Andalusian universities from  the prediction and diagnosis of risk groups and the recommendation of preventive  measures. Among the measures we propose for prevention, we highlight those that  have an impact on pedagogical factors. We propose measures targeting the factors  that predict dropout and the implementation of preventive measures.

Introduction  The adoption of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) has led to the acceptance of new  challenges for the Spanish education system, which has been forced to turn its attention to ways of  increasing educational quality and continuous improvement ( Le et al., 2020 ;   Cervero et al., 2021 ).  Within the framework of the strategic actions adopted for the European Union as a whole, the  objective is to increase the percentage of young people with university degrees, so that the completion  of university studies is nowadays a priority, which requires actions that make it possible for students  OPEN ACCESS  EDITED BY  Antonio Hernandez Fernandez,  University of Jaén,  Spain  REVIEWED BY  Juan López,  Universidad de Granada,  Saint Barthélemy  Mª Teresa Castilla Mesa,  Universidad de Málaga,  Spain  Inmaculada Ávalos Ruiz,  University of Jaén,  Spain  Antonio Luque,  University of Almeria,  Spain  *CORRESPONDENCE  María Arias-Corona  mawi46@gmail.com  SPECIALTY SECTION  This article was submitted to  Higher Education,  a section of the journal  Frontiers in Education  RECEIVED   28 November 2022  ACCEPTED   26 January 2023  PUBLISHED   09 February 2023  CITATION  González-González D, Arias-Corona M,  Cárdenas-Cruz A and Vicente-Bújez A (2023)  The impact of academic dropout at the  University of Granada and proposals for  prevention 1 2  Front.

González-González et al.   10.3389/feduc.2023.1110491  Frontiers in   Education   03   frontiersin.org  of the student to the university is also shaped by their prior motivation  to undertake university studies, their expectations of what to expect  when they complete their education and their beliefs about their own  competence to achieve this goal.   Godor (2017)   has highlighted the weight  of factors related to the student’s integration in the institution on the  decision to drop out, which places the role played by the group of which  he or she is a part at the centre of the analysis and, complementarily,  suggests that it is important the university takes an interest in creating  social communities that are built as the core of learning actions. In this  respect, the social nature of learning and the fact that it takes place in a  scenario involving a set of actors (students, teachers, professionals),  requires the creation of guided meeting points that help to increase the  feeling of belonging and are capable of influencing students’ adherence  to the educational practices and policies that are designed.  1.2. Pedagogical actions as a means of  preventing university dropout  According to   Portal Martínez et al. (2022) , pedagogical actions  aimed at the prevention of university dropout are one of the strategic  methods that can be implemented to increase students’ commitment to  their chosen course. Among these actions are those that increase  students’ involvement in the academic process through the creation of  meeting points with teachers and peers, as well as reinforcement and  guidance mechanisms that ensure greater student support.  These actions can be combined with innovative methods, such as the  use of ICT or social media networks, to increase their level of effectiveness  and better support the learner during their academic progress ( Le et al.,  2020 ). In addition, the use of statistical analysis tools and monitoring  strategies that can be incorporated when these actions are implemented  using digital resources makes it easier to audit the performance achieved  by each action, so that it is easier to determine which are effective and  how to optimise those that do not achieve full learner engagement.  De Castro Lima Baesse et al. (2016)   have suggested that the design  of flexible mechanisms in the university system is essential to ensure that  students can adapt their interests, characteristics, and learning styles and  paces to the opportunities provided by the educational institution, so  that the freedom granted to students is key to fostering their adherence  to academic practices and, thus, to their academic success. In this  context,   Godor (2017)   suggest that the monitoring offered to students  to measure their ongoing progress and to supply them with feedback is  very important because it becomes a factor of support and assistance,  extrinsically motivating the student by making visible the link between  their effort and their results. Particularly during the first year of  university, when students are not yet familiar with how this level of  education works, being able to understand how their actions influence  their outcomes can encourage them to engage more deeply in their  education and demonstrate more proactive attitudes, with the university  providing these feedback mechanisms to students ( Laato et al., 2019 ).  2. Methods  2.1. Objectives  The study presented here is part of the research project on academic  failure and dropout in Andalusian universities, financed by FEDER funds.  In this study we propose making a first approach to the phenomenon  of academic failure and dropout in the teaching degree and others in  Andalusian universities from a predictive and diagnostic perspective of  the groups at risk.  2.2. Process  The study consisted of applying an instrument to diagnose the risk  of dropping out of university studies to a sample of first-year university  students enrolled at the University of Granada in different degree  courses. The tool was distributed at the beginning of the second semester  so that students would have already had a preliminary six-month period  of contact with the degree programme, which is essential for them to  understand whether their expectations of the academic process are  realistic, as well as to get to know the institution and integrate socially  and academically. To recruit participants, the questionnaire was  provided to entire groups of students whose teacher showed interest in  collaborating with our research. The sampling technique, therefore,  consisted of the distribution of the research instrument by convenience,  akin to the non-probability sampling process.  2.3. Participants  The diagnostic instrument was applied to 642 first year students of the  University of Granada studying different degrees in different faculties like  Early Childhood Education, Primary Education, Social Education,  Pedagogy,   Nursing,   Business   Administration   and   Management,  Physical Activity and Sports Sciences, Telecommunications, Industrial  Engineering, Engineering of Canals and Ports and double degree in  Primary Education and English Studies belonging to various faculties  such as the Faculty of Education Sciences, Health Sciences, Sciences of  Physical Activity and Sports, School of Telecommunications, Economics  and Business Sciences, Faculty of Law, Faculty of Sciences and School of  Engineering of Canals and Roads. The average age of the student body is  19.66  years, of which 80.4% (516) are women and 19.6% (126) are men.  2.4. Instrument  The “Survey on Successful Student Retention” by   Velázquez and  González (2017) , which the authors applied to a population of nursing  students at the Unidad Académica Multidisciplinaria Matamoros of the  Universidad Autónoma de Tamaulipas, was used to detect subjects at  risk of university failure and dropout.  The instrument has been slightly edited to adapt the wording to the  Spanish context, excluding two of the 73 items proposed by the authors  as they were not considered to be   relevant in the context of this  exploration. Therefore, the tool administered consisted of a survey  composed of 71 items, which was complemented by 6 further questions  through which we attempted to collect some socio-demographic data  from the participants. The items that make up the tool present a 5-degree  Likert-type scale on which the student positions themself according to  their degree of agreement or disagreement with the statement presented.  The survey was provided to students   via   an online access link to a  Google questionnaire, so no method was used to keep the attention of  the subjects.

González-González et al.   10.3389/feduc.2023.1110491  Frontiers in   Education   05   frontiersin.org  highest dropout rate, which can be as high as 64.5%. This high incidence  of dropout is related to the student’s difficulties in adapting to these  modalities, which is a result closely associated with the low attention  that the university system pays to the needs that first-time students may  present in their process of adaptation to university. In this respect, the  freedom granted in these modalities is a handicap for those who are not  able to acquire the organisation, time management and commitment  strategies that predict success, factors that can be reversed with greater  attention through tutoring and student support services, currently not  very available at the university and underused by students ( Cantos  et al., 2021 ).  Pedagogical strategies can contribute to the reduction of the  incidence of university dropout by providing the student with  additional support during the learning process ( Jani, 2022 ). Within  these strategies, models adapted to the characteristics of the students  and their preferences can be adopted, giving students the opportunity  to participate so that the link they create with their peers encourages  synergies between them and thus activates their own learning efficacy.  The most frequently mentioned approaches in previous research, to  name a few, are peer mentoring, the creation of working groups, the  creation of participation channels such as virtual or face-to-face forums  or the incorporation of active methodologies ( Canty et   al., 2020 ;  Frémont and Arnal, 2021 ;   Portal Martínez et al., 2022 ;   Ugwulor-  Onyinyechi et al., 2022 ).  Cohen (2017)   study provides evidence for the effectiveness of  online activities for student self-assessment and monitoring when  students are given feedback on how they can achieve the goals of the  subject they are taking. According to this author, the information  provided to learners is key for them to be able to fully engage in the  tasks they are set, making them aware of how their effort will have a  predictable reward that will help them achieve their goal.  In addition,   Ugwulor-Onyinyechi et al. (2022)   have identified that  when pedagogical strategies are implemented using digital resources,  they are more effective than face-to-face support, suggesting that there  is a significant window of opportunity for the development of these  strategies, for two main reasons: the lower cost to the university system  of strategies based on digital media and the greater capacity of these to  offer flexible and individualised responses for all students, focused on  their particular needs.  Jani (2022)   research has shown that, given the role of the peer  group, the creation of groups that function collaboratively as learning  communities plays an important role in student retention, encouraging  the synergies that are created between students to support their  persistence in the university system. According to this author, when  relationships between students are encouraged, students support each  other during the learning process, which increases the level of  integration of students in the university, which is one of the most  influential factors in the decision to continue, an argument that has also  been defended by   Cantos et al. (2021)   and   Gutierrez-Aguilar et al.  (2021) ,   who justify the building of groups, forums or communities as a  way to reinforce perceived support.  Gupta et al. (2020)   have recognised the role that educational quality  management systems can play in redesigning the didactic and  pedagogical approaches that are implemented in the university, as they  help to conduct a continuous and targeted audit to understand the role  that the strategies that the university implements have on student  retention. To increase the explanatory power of surveys, focus groups  and other tools used to enhance the monitoring of the learner  experience,   Gupta et al. (2020)   suggest that it is imperative that there is  a high level of awareness among educational institutions regarding  student retention, as this will enable a more effective system to  be   implemented to increase the quality of educational provision.  Indeed, a culture of quality needs to be   implemented in higher  education   institutions   to   help   managers   and   decision-makers  understand the important role that student satisfaction during the first  academic year plays in ensuring that students continue their studies  and remain committed throughout their time at university.  4. Conclusion  Access to higher education is currently at an all-time high as a  result of the maximisation of opportunities offered by the education  system at all stages, but the number of students completing university  shows a very high dropout rate, which requires the adoption of  prevention strategies to reverse this complex phenomenon.  Pedagogical strategies can provide avenues of support to keep  learners engaged in the learning process. It is essential to establish  support routes through tutoring and the creation of virtual or face-to-  face meeting points to provide feedback to learners and support the  acquisition of knowledge through participation. Today, the education  system has a number of tools that it can implement to provide students  with flexible support strategies to optimise the assistance perceived by  students, which is seen as a dimension of great importance during the  first academic year at university. Students’ needs for adaptation to the  university environment must be satisfactorily met through didactic  approaches and pedagogical strategies aimed at facilitating students’  understanding of how the degree course they are taking works, making  them aware of the interconnection between the teaching-learning  actions that are developed and the results they can obtain by proactively  participating in them. In addition, students need individualised  strategies and the viability of these is today increased through the use  of technology, so that the student’s commitment to the education they  are receiving can be achieved through the use of various mechanisms  that reinforce the perception of the support received from the  education system.  The adaptation of pedagogical strategies to the characteristics of the  student body can increase the capacity of the education system to retain  students in higher education, increasing the competitiveness of society  as a whole by improving the available human capital. In addition, by  inducing student engagement at a higher level through the use of  pedagogical strategies, the university system will be able to contribute  to the generation of greater well-being among the wider population,  given the relationship between educational attainment and the level of  income, health and quality of life enjoyed by citizens. Therefore,  updating the pedagogical strategies used in universities is not a trivial  matter: the capacity of the social system to generate positive outputs in  the medium and long term lies in them.

This research investigates academic dropout during university  education among first-year students at university level with the aim of  gaining in-depth knowledge of the causes of the phenomenon and based  on its delimitation, to facilitate the programming of lines of action that  allow it to be tackled.  The agreed definition of university dropout is characterised by the  following variables: the dropout of the student from the university degree  in which he/she has enrolled without having passed the requirements for  graduation and, correlatively, the absence of new enrolments in other  degrees at the same educational level in the following 2   years ( Godor,  2017 ). For   Fonseca-Grandón (2018) , the first university year is the most  important in the student’s academic trajectory because it is during this  year that the links with the institution are created and the student’s  commitment to their education is generated. It is during this year that the  highest drop-out rate is quantified and, therefore, it should be seen as a  critical period in which strategies aimed at retaining students should  be drawn up, encouraging them to stay at the university.  Statistics that have so far quantified university dropout have  described it as a problem of significant magnitude that, depending on  the country in question, fluctuates between 10 and 50% of those enrolled  in their first year of university. OECD countries put the average dropout  rate during the first year of university at 24%, although it should  be noted that in countries such as Brazil this rate exceeds 50% ( Bonaldo  and Pereira, 2016 ). In Spain, the latest available data establish the  dropout rate at 33.9%, being higher in public universities, where it  reaches 35% of enrolments ( Cervero et al., 2021 ). For   Roberts (2011)  these rates show that the contemporary university system needs to move  away from its traditional focus on finding strategies to attract new  students and focus on finding ways to ensure that those students who  are interested in its educational services do in fact complete their  education. Indeed, for the author, it is no longer necessary for the  university to aim to increase the enrolment rate, since access to higher  education is guaranteed for almost anyone who wants it, the objective  being that the academic guidance offered at the university should  be adapted to the needs and characteristics of the students who enrol in  order to ensure that the highest possible percentage of students  successfully complete their studies.  Academic dropout is an object of research on which the academic  literature has focused with special emphasis in recent years, given its  correlation with various economic and welfare indicators in the general  population. Indeed, dropping out of higher education is a phenomenon  whose consequences can be tracked in multiple social and productivity  aspects of the societies in which it occurs, making it a problem that is a  priority to be resolved by both education systems and social systems  alike ( Le et al., 2020 ). In justifying the importance of action to curb the  incidence of university failure and dropout, studies such as that of   Portal  Martínez et al. (2022)   underline the magnitude of its effects both at the  microeconomic   level   for   those   who   suffer   from   it   and   at   the  macroeconomic and social level. In this respect, countries where the  dropout rate is higher experience a direct effect on their well-being and  quality of life indicators, as well as a lower capacity for innovation.  Previous studies have linked academic dropout to a very complex  web of causes that interact with personal, academic, pedagogical,  organisational and social dimensions ( De Castro Lima Baesse et al.,  2016 ;   Godor, 2017 ;   Pierella et al., 2020 ). The diversity of factors that may  influence the decision about whether or not to continue with university  life makes it complex to design and establish strategies aimed at reducing  the prevalence of this phenomenon. Moreover, there is no full consensus  in the academic literature regarding possible approaches to university  dropout, given the influence of contextual, individual and institutional  variables on the dropout experience. For this reason, limiting the  research to a specific environment has been envisaged as a way to be able  to dimension the nature of the problem more precisely in a specific  context and, from this environment, to be able to plan responses in  accordance with the needs that have materialised.  1.1. The importance of dropout during the  first year of university  Concern about student dropout has increased in recent years and  the current understanding of this phenomenon allows better approaches  to be designed to reduce it in the near future. According to   De Castro  Lima Baesse et al. (2016) , concern about university dropout is at its peak  today, especially as educational institutions compete with each other to  attract more students, under new management models focused on  maximising the quality of their actions to achieve the best results. The  first year of university is a challenge for students because it requires  them to make a choice that will have a great impact on the individual,  considering aspects such as their vocation, expectations, abilities and  opportunities when choosing the most suitable degree ( Le et al., 2020 ).  In this context, dropout from higher education is most prevalent during  the first year of university, and this has been associated with a number  of causes that require students to make an extra effort to adjust to the  education they are undertaking.  These causes may be inherent to the university system, such as the  organisation of academic processes or the didactic approach from which  teaching-learning actions are designed, they may involve factors related  to the students themselves, such as their intrinsic motivation towards  education, their ability to adapt to the environment or their cognitive  flexibility, or they may comprise mixed dimensions, a category which  includes all those situations and experiences in whose configuration  both the education system and the way in which the individual faces it  participate ( Le et al., 2020 ). Specifically, during the first year, students  adapt to the new learning system and have to learn to manage their time  and learn new work processes, under methodologies with which they  may not be familiar ( Cohen, 2017 ).  According to   Cervero et al. (2021) , university dropout, being a  multi-causal problem, cannot be solved with a single strategic measure,  so that the strategies adopted to reverse it must be multiple, affecting the  different dimensions that cause it. In line with these contributions, it has  been suggested that in order to predict student dropout at university,  research needs to be proposed based on various hypotheses that can  explain the extent to which the various variables that shape the student’s  experience at university play a role in their decision to leave their  studies, drawing up risk profiles based on the likelihood of this decision  materialising   Portal Martínez et al., 2022 . In this respect, research  suggests that the process of making the decision to drop out of university  is complex and involves different stages, from the first moment the  student feels the desire to drop out or considers the possibility of  dropping out, until he or she finally acts and decides to take this step.  The difficulty in deepening understanding of this process lies in the  fact that while it is materialising, the student continues to maintain a link  with the university organisation and responds to the various stimuli that  occur at both the affective and social levels. In addition, this relationship

González-González et al.   10.3389/feduc.2023.1110491  Frontiers in   Education   04   frontiersin.org  The selection of an instrument of this type in order to determine  potential factors that condition educational failure and, in the light of  these, identify which groups could be at greater risk of suffering from  it due to their particular characteristics, responds to the interest of the  education   system   in   anticipating   this   phenomenon   and   acting  preventively, implementing actions that will have a positive impact on  the persistence of students. Furthermore, such a tool helps to identify  measures that may be effective in reducing failure and dropout in  higher education.  The instrument has already been applied and validated in previous  research. Subjects who left any questionnaire field unanswered were  eliminated from the data matrix prior to analysis. Regarding the  reliability of the data from our sample of subjects, Cronbach’s alpha  yields a value of 0.90 (very reliable data) for the total set of items and  with the following values for the factors motivation (0.89), commitment  (0.88),   attitude   and   behaviour   (0.93),   and   socioeconomic  conditions (0.86).  The instrument developed by   Velázquez and González (2017) ,  distributes the items around four factors that, in turn, are broken down  into 12 categories from which the individual’s commitment to their  academic project can be interpreted in a positive sense and, from a  negative perspective, the risk of failure can be identified. These factors,  associated with their categories, are listed in   Supplementary Table 1   and  are as follows: motivation, commitment, attitude and behaviour, and  socio-economic conditions.  Responses were obtained from 642 students enrolled in various  degrees at the University of Granada. The average age of the participants  was 19.66   years. 80.5% of the participants were male and 19.3% female,  leaving 0.2% unidentified.  The items that achieved a mean score of less than 3.00 in the study  are listed below. These cover eight areas, and they are mainly related to  pedagogical factors, which highlights the lack of attention paid to these  dimensions in the university system in which the students who took  part in the research participate.  The variables in which students scored lowest in the study are  related to the coordination of the teaching activity and the pedagogical  strategies implemented in the educational institution, which are factors  that, according to the findings of this research, could ostensibly  be improved at the University of Granada. Specifically, students are  dissatisfied with the organisation of classes and the tutorial action  strategies developed, as well as with the assessment methods used in  the institution, the approach to classes, the recognition of their teachers  and the feedback they receive. Of the 642 students surveyed,  we   established a risk group of 20 students, for whom it would  be necessary to design measures targeting the factors that predict  dropout and implement preventive measures.  In contrast to the results obtained for the lowest scoring items,  which corresponded to pedagogical dimensions, the highest scoring  variables are related to psychological and contextual factors influencing  the students. In the light of the results that have been established, it is  evident that the prevention of early university dropout requires that  pedagogical factors be   addressed by the education system, which  currently show a significant deficit among the students who participated  in the study. Thus, students enrolled in the first year of university at the  institution where the research was carried out show a high intrinsic  motivation towards the degree and towards the professional options to  which it gives access, expressing high expectations for their future  employment. The questionnaire also revealed a high level of integration  of students in their respective faculties, participating in the social  networks that are promoted in the university system, which are mainly  made up of teachers, students and other staff working at the university.  A factor strongly linked to academic engagement is represented by class  attendance, which in the selected sample is very high and may  contribute to academic success, as this dimension correlates with  educational performance.  3. Discussion  University dropout is a problem that makes it difficult for students  to achieve their career aspirations and attain an optimal standard of  living, as it deprives them of those opportunities that depend on  obtaining a higher education qualification ( Anyanwu and Iwuamadi,  2015 ;   Mestan, 2016 ;   Le et al., 2020 ;   Respondek et al., 2020 ). In addition  to having a strong psychological impact on the student, it is also  associated with an investment that brings no return, both at the  individual level and for the education system, which is why addressing  this phenomenon is essential for today’s society ( Perez et al., 2018 ;   Solis  et al., 2018 ). According to   Canty et al. (2020) , researchers studying the  problem of university dropout face several challenges, including the  difficulty of obtaining reliable data that help to understand what  possible strategies can be efficient, the lack of attention paid by the  university system to this issue, and the influence of socio-demographic  factors and personal variables in the configuration of this phenomenon.  The influence of these factors makes it difficult for universities to act in  a preventive manner in the face of university failure and the consequent  dropout of students, especially because the diagnosis of at-risk profiles  requires a period of time spent at the university and, precisely, the  decision to drop out takes place mainly during this first contact,  concentrated in the first academic year.  This first access to university involves a stage that requires the  individual to build his or her strategies for adapting to the social and  organisational space as well as to the demands of the degree. This  process can develop with different levels of success depending on the  student’s characteristics and existing skills, and this may hinder  university integration in those who experience more difficulties in  socialising or who, due to their psychological characteristics, do not  maintain the level of intrinsic motivation necessary to continue in the  process, leading to a higher probability of failure ( Gregori et al., 2018 ).  Furthermore, according to   Mestan (2016) , there are a number of factors  that the university does not have the capacity to intervene in, such as  the financial capacity of students, the emergence of alternative  employment opportunities, health problems or other changes in their  lives that may be particularly impactful during the first year, as the lack  of full adjustment to university life may make students more sensitive  to these changes.  Ideas of giving up their course may be common among first-year  university students, but they do not always materialise in dropping out  because most individuals have a complex web of strengths that help  them overcome difficulties ( Frémont and Arnal, 2021 ;   Mtshweni,  2022 ). Factors supporting continuity include having financial resources,  participating in active teaching methods that are associated with  assessment processes in which effort is valued through understandable  and fair procedures, and receiving support from their teachers and  peers. Likewise, coming to class and staying connected to the learning  process helps to maintain the link with the process and, in this way,  encourages commitment so that the student’s effort lasts over time and  helps them to pass the different subjects that make up the curriculum.  According to   Gregori et al. (2018) , distance learning universities  and, in general, subjects with an online or blended programme have the
