Despite previous academic success and high scores, some students   fi nd it dif fi cult to cope with course demands and drop out. This scoping review aims to address potential gaps in the literature on early student attrition from medical schools, including the in fl uence of the admission process and curricula.  Methods :   A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify relevant articles published in English-language, peer-reviewed journals. The search was scanned from inception to January 2021 using online databases PubMed, Sco- pus, and ERIC. Covidence software was used for article screening and selection. Additional studies were identi fi ed via the reference lists of included articles and by scanning titles and abstracts from high-pro fi le medical education journals.  Results :   The search resulted in 426 titles, of which 60 articles met our eligibility criteria. Student attrition in the early years of medical school is primarily due to academic failure resulting from cognitive factors such as insuf fi cient basic knowledge or learning capacity. However, potential non-cognitive factors such as personal values and challenges, psychological traits, and the effect of speci fi c curricula have not been suf fi ciently explored.  Conclusion :   Medical educators must understand the reasons for attrition among medical students to enhance the overall learning experience and retain promising students. Results varied among studies due to differences in student pop- ulations, admission criteria, assessment methods, and educational approaches across institutions. Cognitive factors are mainly responsible for early dropouts in medical schools. Future research should investigate non-cognitive factors and their impact on student attrition from medical schools.

Introduction  A   dmission to medical school is highly compet- itive and is based largely on previous aca- demic   performance.   The   number   of   applicants usually far exceeds the number of available positions. The highest-performing students on academic and college admission tests (s) are eventually admitted [1]. While most applicants are motivated by a desire to care for the ill, some may be motivated by family pressures,   fi nancial considerations, and the desire to achieve higher social status and respect [2]. However, following   admission   to   medical   school,   some students struggle academically and are unable to cope with the physical and mental requirements of this   fi eld.   These   dif fi culties   may   include   mis- conceptions about medicine as a career, improper selection by the admissions committee, and learning problems related to the curriculum. Despite the effort and time spent by admission committees in selecting the best candidates from a large number of talented applicants, some promising students will eventually drop out. It is dif fi cult to identify the factors predicting student attrition due to the   marked   differences   in   selection   processes, curricula, and student academic backgrounds across Received 1 July 2024; revised 21 July 2024; accepted 3 August 2024.

Results  A total of 426 titles with accessible abstracts were identi fi ed   and   reviewed.   The   titles   and   abstracts were screened for duplicates and irrelevance with Covidence software. A total of 147 duplicate and 192 ineligible   abstracts   were   subsequently   excluded, while 87 met the inclusion criteria. Full articles were then retrieved from the Library of the College of Medicine and Health Sciences (CMHS) and online resources from the Dundee Library. Of the 87 articles initially selected, 50 were excluded as unrelated to the aims of this study. However, an additional 23 articles were identi fi ed from the reference lists of the selected articles and by manually searching high- pro fi le medical teaching journals. Ultimately, 60 ar- ticles were included in the literature review (Fig. 1).  4. Discussion  Student   attrition   can   have   substantial   negative impacts on the reputation of the medical school, the medical   profession,   society ' s   well-being,   and   the students themselves [7]. The admission process is a challenging   task   because   many   cognitive   and noncognitive factors in fl uence the selection of can- didates. A careful review of each component of the admission process and the interrelationships among them is essential for improving the selection process and   improving   student   retention   rates   [9].   The admission   process   must   be   credible,   fair,   and transparent [10]. To this end, the selection process should consider multiple criteria, including perfor- mance in admission examinations, admission com- mittee   opinions,   and   the   selected   applicants '  demographics   [9].   Understanding   the   effects   of different admission tools on student selection and that of the curriculum on student attrition is essen- tial   to   reducing   early   attrition   and   conserving medical school resources.

should be closely monitored to evaluate admission criteria and re fi ne the selection process [58,59]. The medical profession has been dominated by members of higher social classes, likely because individuals from lower socioeconomic classes have fewer educational opportunities, which results in a lower chance of being admitted to a medical school [60]. Several studies have found lower academic achievements and a higher likelihood of withdrawal among ethnic minorities. For instance, one study from   the   UK   reported   that   the   performance   of Caucasian students was superior to that of students of other ethnicities [61].  4.10. Curriculum-in-use  The curriculum is the actual material delivered to the students and taught by each professor. It includes an overt (explicit or written) component and an im- plicit component of unwritten perspectives and values [62]. One of the most important goals of a medical school is to continually improve the curriculum for enhanced learning and foster academic success and professional competence [63]. Medical schools have a responsibility to establish measures to ensure stu- dents ’   development   into   competent   physicians. However, some level of attrition should be allowed to ensure the quality of future physicians [64,65]. While relatively few studies have been conducted on the effects of different curricula on medical school attrition rates, higher attrition rates have been re- ported using traditional curricula in which basic and clinical sciences are taught separately compared with curricula using problem-based learning (PBL) [66]. In PBL, students learn about a subject by working in groups to solve a clinical problem, an approach that motivates students to learn [66]. A 10-year retrospec- tive study of eight Dutch medical schools found lower graduation   rates   among   those   using   traditional curricula compared with those using problem-based curricula [64]. Similar results have been reported in South Africa, where the introduction of a PBL cur- riculum has resulted in improved academic perfor- mance and a signi fi cant decrease in attrition rates [67]. A recent study found that changing the curriculum design from the traditional model to an integrated model, where basic and clinical sciences are taught simultaneously, led to a dramatic decrease in attrition from 41.5% to 3.3% [68]. The advantages of an inte- grated curriculum include earlier clinical involve- ment, prevention of basic science overload, increased use   of   active   learning   methods   in   teaching   and formative   assessment,   and   the   integration   of   a mentorship program to promote learning [68]. These changes may help students manage their stress and responsibilities by allowing more time for extracur- ricular   activities   such   as   community   service   and sports [68,69]. For these reasons, the in fl uence of curriculum design on attrition rate warrants addi- tional studies. Table 2 summarizes the factors that affect early medical student attrition and provides evidence- based   strategies   for   improving   selection   and enhancing student retention.  Table 2.

5. Conclusions  The attrition of students in medical schools is in fl uenced by several factors. Recent studies have mainly linked attrition to academic failure caused by cognitive factors. However, personal and psycho- logical factors may also play a role in attrition, but these factors may not be as common in the early years of university study. Although attrition among undergraduate medical students has been studied extensively in the literature, these studies have been conducted in diverse communities with different methods   of   student   admission,   assessment,   and judgment, resulting in signi fi cant differences among the results. Furthermore, the effects of the curricula on attrition in medical schools are not well studied. It is crucial for medical educators to understand the causes of attrition to prevent the adverse impacts of dropouts   on   students,   medical   schools,   and   the broader medical community.

4.1. Admission examinations  Admission examination results can help predict the students likely to struggle and drop out [11]. The cognitive components of admission examinations can in fl uence student learning processes, ranging from low-level memorization to higher-level un- derstanding,   application,   and   analysis   [12,13]. Noncognitive   components,   such   as   compassion,  fl exibility, motivation to study medicine, integrity, and responsibility, are associated with the student ' s personal traits and their susceptibility to psycho- logical issues [14,15]. The presence of psychological issues may lead to students dropping out of school. Some   studies   have   indicated   that   psychological disorders are more common in later years and may not be easily noticeable during the earlier years [16,17]. Another study suggested that the prevalence of psychological problems is probably higher than what has been of fi cially documented [17]. Generally, cognitive components are considered a better pre- dictor of academic success [12,13]. According to a systematic critical literature review, lower entry ex- amination   performance   was   the   only   consistent predictor for dropping out [5]. Other cognitive var- iables that may predict academic success include pre-university   grade   point   average   (GPA),   and performance   on   written   admission   and   English language examinations. In contrast, the non-cogni- tive variables are evaluated through personal in- terviews (traditional and multiple mini-interviews), emotional   intelligence   tests,   and   the   applicants '  personal pro fi les.  4.2. Pre-university grade point average  Pre-university GPA measures students '   basic ac- ademic   skills.   Admission   to   medical   school   has primarily depended on selecting students with the highest pre-university GPAs across the world. In many countries, admission is granted if the student ' s pre-university   GPA   was   ranked   above   a   certain level or if the student ' s GPA was among the highest scores in the applicant pool. Several studies have demonstrated   a   strong   association   between   high school   grades   and   subsequent   academic   success [18,19]. A study from the Netherlands found that pre-university GPA was related to study success, job development, and scienti fi c performance, however, the GPA alone had no effect on the attrition rate [20]. In contrast, another study reported that the relative risk of attrition was 2.6 times higher for students admitted with lower GPAs compared to those with higher GPAs [21].  4.3. Written medical school admission examinations  Written   admission   examinations   such   as   the United Kingdom Clinical Aptitude Test in the UK, the Undergraduate Medicine and Health Sciences Admission Test in Australia, and the Medical Col- lege Admission Test (MCAT) in the US are used to determine general knowledge and academic ability [22 e 24]. These examinations include problem-solv- ing, critical reasoning, and knowledge of scienti fi c concepts and principles. Students ’   scores on these examinations are then used in combination with other tools during the selection process [3]. Studies with very large student populations have revealed a strong association between written examination re- sults, such as the MCAT, and academic success [18,23,25,26]. A prospective cohort study in Denmark revealed that students admitted based on admission exami- nations were at lower risk of attrition within the   fi rst two years, compared with students admitted solely based on a high pre-university GPA [5]. The authors concluded that GPAs are broad measures of basic academic skills, and for students ranked above the fair e good level, pre-university GPAs would not in-  fl uence academic success. Moreover, Austria used to employ open admission to medical school, with anyone   who   successfully   completed   secondary school   entitled   to   admission.   However,   half   the students   withdrew   before   graduation.   The   intro- duction of admission examinations to the selection process signi fi cantly decreased the probability of attrition [27].  4.4. Language examinations  Language examinations are essential at many in- ternational   medical   schools.   Students   who   are studying medicine in English must have adequate language competency to ful fi ll study goals and as- signments. Students for whom English is a second language may be at a disadvantage when studying and writing examinations in a non-native language. The most accepted tests for English competency assessment are the International English Language Testing System (IELTS) and Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) [28,29]. Both exams are internationally   recognized   by   many   medical   col- leges. Studies have shown that language pro fi ciency greatly   in fl uences   academic   performance   among non-native   English-speaking   students   [30,31].   In Saudi   Arabia,   for   example,   TOEFL   and   MCAT scores are statistically signi fi cant predictors of stu- dent performance [32]. HEALTH PROFESSIONS EDUCATION 2024;10:202 e 210   205

4.5. Personal interviews  Personal interviews are widely used to assess ap- plicants '   interpersonal skills, which are important for future physicians [33]. There are two main types of interviews used for medical school selection: tradi- tional and multiple mini-interviews (MMIs). Tradi- tional   interviews   generally   involve   two   or   more assessors interviewing one applicant. They may be provided with a list of questions but are free to ask other questions. The questions tend to be related to the   applicants '   social   background,   experiences, achievements, and motivations [34]. However, tradi- tional interviews lack a clearly de fi ned scoring rubric, which challenges their reliability and validity [35]. In contrast, MMIs can rapidly and repeatedly assess noncognitive variables to provide a precise mea- surement of the student ' s skills in speci fi c areas such as communication, critical thinking skills, and ethical reasoning   [36].   MMIs can   rate multiple   qualities relevant to a medical career with acceptable reliability and validity [37]. In a typical structured MMI, appli- cants alternate through several stations and reply to standardized questions in different scenarios. Each station has an examiner who assesses the candidate ' s responses   according   to   a   standardized   scoring descriptor   [38,39].   The   assessors   receive   general training about the MMI examination, the rationale for its use, and the logistics for running the stations. Candidates are oriented to the process as well. Compared   to   traditional   interviews,   MMIs   are more   reliable, valid,   feasible, and   acceptable for both applicants and interviewers [38,40,41]. Studies have found that MMI scores are a signi fi cant pre- dictor of success in the early years of medical school [42,43]. However, MMIs may not detect subtle per- sonality traits that could negatively impact academic progress and career as a physician, such as speci fi c cognitive de fi cits, impulsive actions, and dysfunc- tional interpersonal relationships [44 e 46].  4.6. Emotional intelligence tests  Emotional intelligence (EI) includes a critical set of intrapersonal skills that are highly relevant to the medical   profession.   Physicians   with   strong   EI demonstrate effective communication and empathy to build trust with patients, work collaboratively in healthcare teams, and manage their own emotions to   avoid   burnout   [47].   Evaluating   EI   in   medical school admissions and encouraging its growth in students may help create empathetic, cooperative, and   resilient   physicians   capable   of   delivering exceptional   patient-centered   care   [48].   Generally, self-report   questionnaires   are   used   to   assess emotional intelligence in medicine. However, some studies have found that these tests do not reliably predict future academic performance [48,49].  4.7. Personal pro fi le  An   applicant ' s   personal   pro fi le   may   include   a personal statement and letters of recommendation. However,   concerns   have   been   raised   about   the credibility of personal statements and their value as an indicator of future academic and professional performance   [50,51].   Similarly,   letters   of   recom- mendation may provide important information to guide decisions on interview selection and candi- date admission; however, non-standardized letters generally have low predictive validity and there is limited evidence about their value in the selection of medical students [52]. For these reasons, there is growing interest in using a structured format for letters with detailed writing guidance and the use of rating scales for important competencies [44,53].  4.8. Student demographics  In some countries, the selection process takes place immediately   after high school (as in the United Kingdom) or after several years of general university studies (as in the United States and Australia) [3]. There is con fl icting evidence regarding the effects of age at admission on attrition rate. A retrospective study   performed   at   Nottingham   University,   UK, found no relationship between age of entry to med- ical school and attrition rate [7]. However, another study reported that older students aged 21 years and above were less likely to withdraw than younger students [54]. Likewise, while some studies have found no relationship between gender and attrition [5,55], others have found attrition to be more com- mon among females [27,56,57].  4.9. Selection process  A proper selection process for student admission can improve learning ef fi ciency and professional outcomes. The selection process should combine the scores of several selection tools and use weighted formulas to rank applicants [9]. These selection tools usually include high school grades, a written stan- dardized entry exam, assessment of noncognitive variables by personal interviews and other social skills assessments, and, in some cases, demographic characteristics.   The   decision-making   style   of   the committee and voting patterns among the members are critical for effective selection [3].

institutions and nations [3]. Most studies on student attrition focus on the predictive validity of various entry   quali fi cations   and   related   attributes   of   the students. These studies have been performed in different communities with different admission re- quirements [3,4]. In a systematic critical literature review of medical education, the attrition rate varied widely, with an average of 9.1% (2.7% e 20.1%) [5]. Different terms have been used to describe attri- tion,   including   withdrawal,   expulsion,   dismissal, academic   failure,   and   dropout.   However,   these terms do not precisely de fi ne the causes of attrition. For example, attrition may be caused by the cur- riculum   at   a   speci fi c   medical   school   which   is different from voluntary withdrawal due to social issues   or   dismissal   for   improper   behavior   [6,7]. Moreover, students may reconsider their decision to join   medical   school   and   voluntarily   withdraw, especially in their early years [8]. Educational in- terventions by the medical school can help improve the academic performance of students who may leave due to academic dif fi culties. Therefore, this scoping review aims to identify gaps in the literature regarding   the   factors   in fl uencing   early   student attrition from medical schools including the poten- tial impacts of the admission process and curricu- lum design.  2. Methods  2.1. Overview  A comprehensive literature search was conducted in January 2021 for English-language articles pub- lished in peer-reviewed journals on early medical school   attrition   using   three   online   databases (PubMed, Scopus, and ERIC). Table 1 presents the inclusion and exclusion criteria used for selecting the reviewed articles. The literature search focused on identifying factors in the admissions process that in fl uence   attrition   in   the   early   years   of   medical school.  2.2. PubMed search  The PubMed search was performed for articles published in English from 1971 to 2021 using the following   MeSH   key   words:   “ Schools,   Medical ”  [MeSH],   “ medical   school * ”   [Title/Abstract])   and  “ Student Dropouts ”   [MeSH],   “ College Admission Test ”   [MeSH],   “ Student Dropouts ”   [Title/Abstract],  “ College   Admission   Test ”   [Title/Abstract])   and ( “ Education, Medical, Undergraduate ”   [MeSH], or  “ medical   undergraduate * ”   [Title/Abstract]).   The search terms were selected from MeSH terms related to this study. The MeSH term   “ Student Dropouts ”  covered attrition and withdrawal terms while   “ Col- lege Admission Test ”   covered the student selection process. The search was limited to the title and ab- stract   fi elds (when available) and yielded 189 articles.  2.3. Scopus search  Scopus was searched from inception in 2004 e 2021 using a   fi lter for English, and all keywords were combined with   “ title, ” “ abstract, ”   and   “ keywords. ”  The   fi nal search string was as follows: ((TITLE-ABS- KEY   ( “ medical   school * ” )   and   TITLE-ABS-KEY ( “ student dropout * ” ) or ( “ college admission test * ” ) and TITLE-ABS-KEY ( “ medical undergraduate * ” )) and (LIMIT-TO (LANGUAGE,   “ English ” )). A total of 174 articles were retrieved.  2.4. ERIC search  ERIC was searched from database inception in 1966 e 2021. Likewise, a   fi lter for English was applied and all keywords were searched in combination with  “ title ” ,   “ abstract ” ,   and   “ Thesaurus   (DE) ”   (when available). The search string included (AB   “ medical school * ”   or TI   “ medical school * ”   or DE   “ Medical Schools ” ) and (AB   “ student dropout * ”   or TI   “ student dropout * ”   or DE   “ Dropouts ”   or AB   “ college admis- sion test * ”   or TI   “ college admission test * ”   or DE  Table 1.
