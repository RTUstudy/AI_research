Explaining those rates calls for a comprehensive and holistic approach  beyond the students’ socio-economic characteristics. This study seeks to identify  the socio-demographic, academic and psychological variables that predict dropout  intention among university students in Peru.  Materials and method:   The sample was composed of 768 students from nine  universities, both public and private, across the coastal, highland and rainforest  regions of Peru. Students completed questionnaires assessing factors that favor  resilience, future orientation, and dropout intention.  Results:   As hypothesized, we found that students who scored higher on factors  favoring resilience and future orientation subscales, with the exception of the  exploration sub-dimension, were less likely to develop dropout intentions. We  found differences by sex and type of university; then evaluated whether the  model parameters varied by sex. Our findings show higher dropout intentions  among male students. No significant relationships were found between grades,  tutoring programme and future orientation.  Discussion:   Results contribute to support these university students as valuable human  resources who, due to Peru’s characteristics, lack easy access to higher education  and should be protected. Our findings also provide general guidelines for further  interventions to counter the risk of increased dropout rates at the university level.  KEYWORDS  future orientation, factors favoring resilience, dropout intentions, tutoring  programme, university students  1 Literature review  Education is widely acknowledged as pivotal for human development and it is essential to  promote sustainable economic growth ( Higuera et al., 2023 ). In Peru, the 15–29 demographic  cohort comprises 23.58% of the labor force. Within this group, only 19.4% hold university degrees,  while 16.8% have non-university qualifications, and 52.7% only completed secondary education  ( Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática, 2022 ). In addition, according to the Ministry of  Education of Peru ( Ministerio de Educación, 2022 ), 23.2% of individuals under 30 have dropped  out of university. These statistics highlight a significant loss of valuable human resources and raise  questions about the ultimate fate of these students, with a considerable number likely to end up  working in fields that may not align with their personal interests. This underscores the urgent need  to investigate the underlying predictors of university dropout, especially since such decisions are  shaped by a complex interplay of factors ( Lizarte Simón and Gijón Puerta, 2022 ).

Commitment refers to the decision to  pursue an option and obtain results ( Erikson, 1968 , p. 165;   Stolarski  et al., 2015 ).  It is essential to point out that future orientation plays a vital role in  setting clear goals ( Seginer, 2008 ). In educational contexts, when career  goals   are   perceived   to   be   in   jeopardy,   under   Seginer   (2009)  multidimensional model, the hope subcomponent of future orientation  becomes crucial. Empirical investigations consistently emphasize that  psychological and academic outcomes tend to be healthier for individuals  and students with a clear and stable future orientation ( Liu et al., 2023 ;  Stoddard and Pierce, 2015 ). This subjective representation of future goals  within the educational domain reinforces academic hopes and self-  efficacy, which in turn help students overcome obstacles ( Seginer, 2008 )  and reduce the likelihood of dropping out.  In sum, future orientation regulates behavior motivationally,  fosters persistence, and supports the achievement of long-term  objectives ( Averill et al., 1990 ;   Lin et al., 2024 ;   Pawlak and Moustafa,  2023 ), all of which are essential in reducing the probability of dropout  intentions. It is noteworthy that research from the early 2000s pointed  out that these effects are linked to career exploration and clearly  defined professional goals ( Gushue et al., 2006 ;   Yowell, 2000 ). In line  with this, theories of future-oriented self-regulation argue that specific  and individualized future goals guide the creation of instrumental  subgoals. These subgoals help students select tasks that contribute to  future goal attainment, while shaping different levels of engagement  in the pursuit of those goals ( Miller and Brickman, 2004 ).  Future orientation and resilience are both important variables to  study in addressing student dropout. For instance,   Schmid and Lingas  (2022)   identify several factors that promote resilience in a vocational  context. According to their findings, factors such as commitment to  learning, perseverance, self-regulated learning, goal orientation, self-  efficacy, and help-seeking are crucial for enhancing resilience among  students. Similarly,   Lin et   al. (2024)   highlight the bidirectional  relationship between individual characteristics and contextual factors,  which together influence various aspects of behavior. Additionally,  when future orientation was explored in students who had difficult  learning experiences and were inserted in contexts that reinforced a  negative self-perception of their academic capabilities, it was found that  they do not prioritize long term goals; instead, they explicitly report  preferences for short-term courses and undemanding occupational  activities ( Arkin and Cojocaru, 2020 ). University careers and the  subsequent path of working in the selected field requires far-reaching  goals. Therefore, this study aims to explore how both variables,  individual   and   interpersonal,   may   negatively   predict   dropout  intentions. Identifying them will help university authorities orient  policies and preserve valuable resources ( De Witte et al., 2013 ;   Lehr  et al., 2003 ;   Morelli et al., 2023 ).  1.3 Protecting factors of dropout intentions  In light of the above, identifying protective factors is crucial to  prevent university attrition. University dropout is a multidimensional  phenomenon defined as the abandonment of an academic program  before graduation, which significantly impacts the future life of  students ( Lopez Angulo et al., 2021 ;   Poveda, 2019 ). Attrition, however,  refers to events that have already occurred. Therefore, identifying  protective factors related to the   intention   to drop out, which appears  mostly during the first 3 years of study, before career abandonment  takes place ( Bean and Metzner, 1985 ), is key. These early intentions  have been proven a valid predictor of dropout ( Findeisen et al., 2024 ).  This is why the present research model considers dropout intention as  a criterion variable (see   Figure 2 ).  In order to identify predictive factors related to potential dropout,  additional indicators have been considered, including performance  and tutoring as academic and institutional variables. Tutoring is  relevant because it provides students with personal as well as academic  support ( Dávila Morán et al., 2022 ;   Morelli et al., 2021 ). Furthermore,  considering previous findings, sex was included as a relevant variable  because some studies have found lower dropout rates for women than  for men ( González, 2005 ), while others report the opposite result  ( Graciano and Orozco, 2022 ;   Meyer and Strau, 2019 ).  In sum, the present study aims to test the hypothesized model by  positing that protective factors favoring resilience, performance and  tutoring, mediated by the career domain of future orientation,  negatively predict dropout intention (see   Figure 2 ). Furthermore, the  study also seeks to determine which variables, be it sociodemographic,  academic (performance and tutoring) or psychological (protective  factors favoring resilience and future orientation), predict dropout  intention in students of public and private Peruvian universities.

Herrera et al.   10.3389/feduc.2024.1476426  Frontiers in   Education   08   frontiersin.org  long-term goals and career prospects, educational institutions have an  opportunity to leverage the positive impact of future orientation for  the enhancement of student commitment, which will ultimately  contribute to reducing attrition or dropout intention rates ( Pawlak  and Moustafa, 2023 ).  In accordance with our empirical model, this study’s findings  indicate that among the three antecedent variables that impact  dropout intention indirectly via future orientation, resilience has a  considerably stronger impact than educational achievement (GPA)  and institutional provisions (tutoring programme). Comparatively,  having higher grades at baseline or attending a university that provides  tutoring support were unrelated to dropout intention. These results  bolster the growing literature ( Arakaki et al., 2019 ;   García Del Castillo  et al., 2016 ;   Herrera, 2019 ;   Pérez and Mejía, 1998 ;   Seginer, 2008 ;   Von  Bargen, 2011 ) on the importance of protective factors that contribute  to the maintenance and growth of human resources and human  capabilities, both individually and contextually, among other aspects  ( García Del Castillo et   al., 2016 ;   Pérez and Mejía, 1998 ;   Von  Bargen, 2011 ).  When analyzing other specific variables, the psychological  literature suggesting that attrition is related to sex as a function of  career must also be   considered. For example, male students in  Australian universities show a tendency to drop out when inserted as  practitioners in pre-school services ( Kirk, 2020 ), while dropout rates  among female students in the United States are higher when careers  are linked to the science domain ( Fisher et al., 2022 ). As noted above,  and consistent with previous research ( Lizarte Simón and Gijón  Puerta, 2022 ), our study found no significant interaction between sex  and career, perhaps due to insufficient statistical power. We suggest  analyzing this relationship in further studies with larger samples.  This study reveals a notable trend where men express higher  dropout   intentions.   The   pattern   aligns   with   findings   in   the  United States, where the gender gap in education shifted to a 14%  advantage for women in 2019 in contrast with 1972, when men were  12% more likely to earn a bachelor’s degree, and where males are less  likely to graduate high school and complete college ( Reeves and  Smith, 2021 ). Similar observations have been made globally since  2002, with a growing gender gap favoring female students and most  OECD countries enrolling more women than men in college ( Goldin  et al., 2006 ). Although our study reveals a positive correlation between  women and GPA, its significance in the model is inconclusive,  emphasizing the need for future research using standardized data and  stronger correlations for a more accurate prediction of this relationship.  The growing gap between men and women is often attributed to  the increasing participation of women in the labor force and structural  changes in the economy ( Parker, 2021 ). Some relevant studies confirm  that socioeconomic status, age at first marriage, and more effective  birth-control methods are also key explanatory factors ( Goldin and  Katz, 2002 ;   Goldin et al., 2006 ), but it is noteworthy that additional  psychological and social dimensions are yet to be investigated in  detail. Further studies are needed to explore the reasons for these  differences across ethnic and socioeconomic groups.  It is important to note, also, that we found no relevant differences  in dropout intention between students by region, even though  SUNEDU data (2020) does reveal regional differences in dropout  rates. Even allowing for the fact that dropout intention is distinct from  FIGURE 3  Structural equation modeling predicting dropout intentions.  TABLE 2   Invariance tests based on multigroup SEM for sex.

As   Sen (1998)   observes, an  interrupted education deprives one of opportunities to enhance  freedom and reduce insecurity ( London and Formichella, 2006 ).  In this context, our study’s contributions center on probing the  subjective dimension in order to comprehend how individuals  confront adversity. This represents a distinct framework for analyzing  education within the context of human development, challenging the  socio-economic determinism that all too commonly pervades views  of the dropout issue.

Herrera et al.   10.3389/feduc.2024.1476426  Frontiers in   Education   02   frontiersin.org  University   dropout   rates   do   not   depend   exclusively   on  socioeconomic conditions or the educational system. They are a  multidimensional   phenomenon   impacted   by   socioeconomic,  sociodemographic, academic, and psychological factors ( Díaz Peralta,  2008 ;   Herrera, 2019 ;   Nussbaum, 2000 ). This study aims to explore the  relationship between psychological protective factors, such as resilience  and future orientation, and dropout intentions. Additionally, it will  examine the role of two key antecedents—tutoring programs and GPA—  and discuss how these factors interact with various sociodemographic  characteristics in shaping students’ decisions to leave university.  Taking into consideration psychological explanations about career  decisions among Peruvian adolescents, research findings show that  career plans are not always aligned with the goals students initially set  for themselves at the end of their secondary schooling ( Herrera, 2002 ).  These findings have prompted researchers to consider whether the  careers or jobs of young Peruvians articulate their interests, skills,  plans, and goals, or the requirements of the labor market ( Herrera,  2019 ;   Lens et al., 2012 ).  This study seeks to understand the specific role of protective  factors that strengthen students’ capabilities to diminish their  academic dropout intentions. Several Latin American studies have  highlighted that both protective and risk factors play a crucial role in  the decision to drop out at the individual level ( Chalela-Naffah et al.,  2020 ;   Chalpartar Nasner et al., 2022 ;   Dávila Morán et al., 2022 ;   Lopez  Angulo et al., 2021 ;   Poveda, 2019 ). Given that protective factors have  the potential to mitigate dropout risk, in this study we examine the  impact of the former: resilience and future orientation. Both have  been shown to counterbalance adversity and support individuals in  navigating academic challenges ( Cusack et al., 2016 ;   Seginer, 2008 ).  1.1 Resilience  Resilience is a powerful protective factor in the development of  human potential ( Aburn et al., 2016 ;   Cárdenas-Jiménez and López-  Díaz, 2011 ;   McKinley et al., 2019 ;   Turner and Holdsworth, 2022 ;  Wilks, 2008 ). Researchers define it as an individual and dynamic  process of positive and interactive adaptation to the environment  ( Luthar et al., 2000 ). It encompasses a complex, holistic, and cyclical  system that involves the human capacity to cope with, overcome, and  be strengthened or transformed by experiences of adversity ( Grotberg,  2003 ;   Henderson, 2003 ).  Before defining resilience, researchers focused on identifying  qualities that help children confront adversity, initially studying  vulnerability and risk factors ( Anthony and Koupernik, 1974 ).   Werner  and Smith’s (1982)   30-year study of children born in adverse  conditions in Hawaii found that 30% displayed traits like self-  discipline, communication skills, motivation, and self-confidence,  which enabled them to overcome challenges despite family conflict,  health issues, and poverty. Unlike others, these resilient children  formed close bonds with at least one stable caregiver, which supported  their resilience ( Muñoz-Silva, 2012 ;   Werner and Smith, 1982 ). This  study paved the way for examining both individual attributes and  environmental factors that reduce the likelihood of negative behaviors  ( García Del Castillo et al., 2016 ;   Garmezy, 1974 ;   Luthar et al., 2000 ;  Masten et al., 1990 ;   Uriarte, 2005 ).  Based on empirical research, resilience is indicated by cognitive-  individual and interpersonal factors ( Cusack et al., 2016 ;   Garcia-Vesga  and Dominguez-de la Ossa, 2013 ;   Ponce-García et al., 2015 ). In the  first dimension, two variables contributing to resilience are salient:  future planning and goal-efficacy. Studies have found that future  planning, the process by which an individual formulates goals and  develops plans to achieve those goals, has important effects on  decision making about career life ( Fahmi and Ali, 2022 ). Furthermore,  this construct is also associated with self-confidence and self-efficacy  ( Fahmi and Ali, 2022 ). Along similar lines, goal-efficacy, which  reflects confidence in one’s ability to accomplish goals and succeed,  was proven to be an important factor negatively associated with  dropout intentions ( Bardach et al., 2019 ), while commitment to  achieving personal and career goals was a frequent reason reported by  students as helping them to stay at university ( Nieuwoudt and  Pedler, 2023 ).  The interpersonal dimension of resilience is represented by social  support and social skills. For instance, social support has been  identified as an important factor in students’ decisions to remain at  university ( De la Cruz-Campos et al., 2023 ;   Nieuwoudt and Pedler,  2023 ), including support from family ( Villafrade and Franco, 2016 ),  academic supervisors and institutional resources ( Zhang et al., 2024 ).  The social skills variable acts in ways similar to social support,  integrating the interpersonal dimension associated with resilience.  Research has shown that social skills, empirically proven to support  processes of resilience, are an important protective factor against stress  ( Luthar, 1991 ), associated with a lower risk of student dropout  ( Marschall et al., 2023 ).  1.2 Future orientation  Future orientation is a subjective representation of the future; it  regulates present behaviors and actively engages individuals in the  formulation of clear plans for accomplishing their future goals, according  to their age, gender and culture. Those plans are then applied to different  life domains, among which career or family are prioritized depending  on the developmental stage ( Seginer, 2009 ). It should be noted that  images of the future are constructed on the basis of contents that can  be personal or social, realistic or ideal ( Stolarski et al., 2015 ).  Future orientation has been empirically represented as a three-  component model wherein the motivational, cognitive, and behavioral  dimensions are connected in a sequence ( Seginer, 2009 ,   2017 ). As  previously noted, future orientation can be analyzed in different  domains during adolescence and youth: career/education and family.  This study focuses on the career/education domain, since adolescents  and young people already inserted in the educational system tend to  center their plans on the career domain ( Herrera, 2019 ). Furthermore,  focusing on this life domain in university students allows for a more  precise analysis of these youngsters’ plans and perceptions of their  future academic and professional lives. Nevertheless, it should  be remarked that, in either domain (career/educational or family) the  motivational component leads directly and in parallel to the behavioral  dimension ( Seginer, 2009 ,   2017 ;   Seginer et al., 2004 ) (see   Figure 1 ).  According to the model, three empirical variables function as  indicators for the motivational component: the value of future goals,  the subjective expectation or probability that plans will materialize,  and the person’s sense of internal control or responsibility to realize  them ( Seginer, 2009 ,   2017 ). The cognitive component refers to the  extent to which the person thinks about the future in terms of hopes  and fears. The behavioral component involves exploration, which  includes seeking information and advice about future options, as well

Herrera et al.   10.3389/feduc.2024.1476426  Frontiers in   Education   04   frontiersin.org  To develop this study, the following research questions were  specified: (1) To what extent do factors contributing to resilience, past  academic achievement (GPA), and the existence of a tutoring program  at the university serve as protective factors against students’ dropout  intention?; (2) Does future orientation mediate the relationship  between factors contributing to resilience, past academic achievement  (GPA), and the existence of a tutoring program on students’ intention  to drop out of university?; (3) Is the hypothetical research model  invariant by sex?; and (4) Are there demographic differences (career,  university type, and student role) in the relationship between  resilience, GPA, and the existence of a tutoring program and students’  dropout intention?  This   study’s   hypothetical   model   postulates   that   factors  contributing to resilience, GPA, and the existence of a tutoring  program at the university predict dropout intention mediated by  future orientation.  2 Materials and methods  2.1 Participants  The sample for this study consisted of 768 university students aged  18–30 (230 male, 532 female, and six who preferred not to report their  sex), enrolled in the first 3 years of their undergraduate programmes.  Data collection took place during the first weeks of the first/s semester  of the 2022 academic year.  Careers were diversified along the universities selected, but the  majority of participants were enrolled either in a health-related field  ( n   =   285), engineering ( n   =   164) or humanities ( n   =   85). Participants’  mean age was 21.46   years and the majority were single ( n   =   736). A  number of additional socio-demographic variables were used to  characterize the sample, among them: current semester of enrollment  (second to fourth   =   33.98%; fifth to seventh   =   39.71%; eighth to  tenth   =   26.30%), self-perceived socioeconomic level (High   =   1.95%;  Medium   =   63.02%; Low   =   35.03%), participant’s other roles (study  only   =   41.80%; study and work   =   58.20%), parents’ educational level  (Father:   not   educated   =   1.56%;   secondary   =   28.91;   university/  technical   =   66.01%; others   =   3.52%. Mother: not educated   =   0.78%;  secondary   =   30.34%; university/technical   =   67.84%; others   =   1.04%).  First semester students were excluded because their previous grades were  not available yet.  All universities selected for the study were licensed by SUNEDU  (Peru’s National Superintendence of Higher Education, in its Spanish  acronym)   ( Superintendencia   Nacional   de   Educación   Superior  Universitaria, 2020 ,   2023 ) and had operated for at least 10 years. They  are all members of the   Red Peruana de Universidades   and represent  three regions of the country (coast, highlands, and rainforest). The  Vice President for Research of the university conducting the study  contacted the nine vice chancellors from the other institutions and  invited them to participate. Thus, the total number of universities adds  up to nine: three from the coast ( n   =   332), two from the highlands  ( n   =   182) and four from the rainforest region ( n   =   254). After each  student’s consent and the Ethical Committee’s green light were  obtained, students were asked to complete self-report questionnaires.  It should be noted that eight of the participating universities offered  tutoring programmes for students and one was in the process of  implementing it.  We contacted 1,597 students. Of this group, 48 declined to  participate. Many completed the questionnaire only partially and were  excluded from the sample. Only 768 completed the questionnaire in  full. These students voluntarily participated in the research project and  provided active consent. Participants interested in learning the  research results had the option to provide their email address and  be contacted at the end of the study.  2.2 Measures  2.2.1 Scale of protective factors (SPF-24) of  resilience Spanish version  The questionnaire was developed by   Ponce-García et al. (2015)   to  assess   four   protective   factors   categorized   in   two   dimensions  (cognitive-individual and interpersonal factors) previously described  (see page 2). These factors were empirically proven as determinants of  resilience by past research (Reich et al., 2010 in   Ponce-García et al.,  2015 ). It features 24 items divided into four factors: (a) Social Support  (i.e.,   My friends/family keep me up to speed on important events ), (b)  Social Skills (i.e.,   I am good at making new friends ), (c) Future Planning  (i.e.,   When working on something, I do better if I set a goal ), and (d)  FIGURE 2  Theoretical model.

Another relevant variable investigated in this study was the type  of university. There are a total of 96 accredited universities in Peru, 48  of them private and 48 public, as recorded by national entities  ( Superintendencia Nacional de Educación Superior Universitaria,  2023 ). Our research found differences in terms of protective  psychological factors between the two types of institutions. Students  in private universities reported higher value of their career, the only  protective factor distinguishing them from their peers in public  universities. On the other hand, public university students scored  higher in social skills, goal-efficacy, and hopes. These findings are  quite surprising, as they contradict the prevailing stereotype that  social skills are less developed in public-system students. The  stereotype was explored by   Barreda-Parra et al. (2022) , who reported  that students in public universities experience poorer interpersonal  and social relationships due to gender stereotypes. Nevertheless, other  research has shown that even though public university students report  higher neuroticism, suggesting that they are more likely to display  emotional instability and poor impulse control, this trait may  be positively related to undergraduate students’ academic achievement  ( Chowdhury, 2006 ;   De Feyter et al., 2012 ;   Komarraju et al., 2011 ).  Moreover,   Tan and Mohd (2015)   found that public university students  are more conscientious than their private university counterparts,  which means that they are more responsible and organized, and thus  more likely to have better academic performance.  Another interesting finding was that working while studying was  significantly related with being male and associated, almost across the  board, with higher scores in most of the variables that contribute to  resilience (goal-efficacy, future planning and social skills). Students  who work also have better future orientation (expectance, hopes, and  exploration). However, these students reported at the same time lower  social support and higher dropout intentions. It could be that working  provides students with greater opportunities for psychological growth,  resulting in improved functioning, but does so at a cost. The short-  term prospect of an income might tempt students to abandon their  studies in order to work full-time, at the expense of potential future  earnings. For instance, a recent study by   Garrido and Pajuelo (2023)  found that, in Peru, the most relevant economic indicators at the time  of dropping out are family income and economic dependence, albeit  the latter indicator is less predictive.  Education does have an impact on economic returns. For example,  in Indonesia, individuals with a university education earn up to 60%  more than their counterparts with only secondary or full primary  education ( Yubilitanto, 2020 ). In Peru, however, there is no recent  evidence for higher economic returns resulting from a university  education in contrast with alternatives ( Yamada, 2007 ). This suggests  the need for further discussion about how the expectation of a quick  return on investment in higher education, or the need to start working  while studying to cover expenses, may affect future earnings and  stability. It is also likely that the time devoted to work cannot then  be used for socializing, resulting in decreased perceptions of social  support relative to students who are not employed, which in turn may  foster the development of dropout intentions. Recent studies provide  some insights regarding this topic ( Garrido and Pajuelo, 2023 ;   Kocsis  and Pusztai, 2020 ;   Lorenzo-Quiles et   al., 2023 ;   Sayed, 2023 ).  Meanwhile, our findings suggest interesting questions for further  research: Should students be advised to pursue paid work during their  studies? What type of student benefits from this, and who is more  likely to see their future earnings potential hindered by early dropout?  While several hypotheses come to mind (e.g., students with lower  rates of temporal discounting are more likely to stick with their studies  in the long run while accruing the psychological benefits of work), our  data cannot speak to these possibilities.  Some limitations of our research should be pointed out. First,  while GPA was collected separately at baseline, students reported their  psychosocial protective factors, future orientation, and dropout  intentions at the same point in time. This, along with the fact that  we were unable to manipulate students’ psychosocial, academic, and  institutional protective factors, prevents us from making strong causal  claims about our findings. Second, even if researchers considered the  period of the semester when recruiting the sample, data collection  occurred at two different time points, and variations in the academic  cycle could have influenced student responses. Finally, the study  determined the presence or absence of a tutoring programme by  referring to the university’s website, which did not describe the level  of specialization or quality of these services in greater depth.  In connection to this last point, one important question that may  need to be addressed is why does not the presence or absence of a  tutoring programme in a university predict the relationship with  dropout intentions? Three potential explanations may account for this  finding. First, the quality of the tutoring programmes on offer may not  be sufficient to make a difference for this group of students. Second, it  is possible that the effect of tutoring is already accounted for by the  psychosocial protective factors investigated at the level of the  individual student. Finally, all but one of the universities in our sample  had tutoring programmes, so the lack of variation might complicate  these estimates.  Despite these limitations, our study uses a large, diverse sample  with national coverage, in an externally valid setting, to add to the  evidence   that   students’   psychosocial   factors   matter   for   the  development of human resources. Building on this foundation, further  research is encouraged to delve deeper into the nuances of those  psychosocial factors, enabling educational institutions to craft holistic  strategies that not only retain students, but also foster their personal  and academic growth during challenging times.  University dropout in general is a serious problem across the  world ( Morelli et al., 2023 ). When students drop out and give up on  their higher education plans, the result is a decline in the human  resources required for social and economic growth. Moreover, it also  results in a loss of those human capabilities that promote human  freedom, preventing individuals from leading lives aligned with their  choices ( Sen, 1998 ). Dropping out of higher education interrupts a life  project that many young people consider valuable, limiting their skills  and opportunities, and pushing the chosen path out of reach for many  who would have benefited from continuing their studies ( Villareal and  Zayas-Pérez, 2021 ).  Our research underscores that dealing with high dropout rates, a  significant challenge in higher education, necessitates comprehensive  approaches that extend beyond the socio-economic characteristics of  students. In light of these findings, a multidimensional approach is  suggested,   one   that   takes   into   consideration   individual   and  interpersonal factors that either safeguard or jeopardize a student’s  pursuit of valued goals. An untimely interruption of professional

Participants  evaluated each item on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly  disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). In the original version of the scale,  validity evidence according to the internal structure was favorable.  The Spanish version confirmatory factor analysis reported adequate  fit   indexes   ( χ 2   =   516.34,   df   =   239,   p   <   0.001,   CFI   =   0.946,  RMSEA   =   0.059),   ultimately   retaining   24   items   of   the   scale.  Furthermore, validity evidence based on the relation with other  variables was supported using two common measures of resilience,  the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC;   Connor and  Davidson, 2003 ) and de Resilience Scale (RS;   Wagnild and Young,  1993 ). The scale showed satisfactory internal reliability indices of 0.89  for goal-efficacy, 0.92 for social skills, 0.89 for planning and 0.86 for  social support. In the present study, the factor structure of the scale  was replicated by a confirmatory factor analysis with good fit  ( χ 2   =   1707.506, df   =   246,   p   <   0.001, CFI   =   0.996, RMSEA   =   0.069,  SRMR   =   0.048). Factor loadings were significant ( p   <   0.001) and  ranged between 0.68 and 0.94. Cronbach’s alphas were 0.86 for social  support, 0.93 for social skills, 0.91 for future planning and 0.95 for  goal-efficacy.  2.2.2 Prospective life course questionnaire  This self-reported questionnaire developed by   Seginer (2009)  registers thoughts and opinions regarding Future Orientation in two  life domains: career/work and family. Given our objective of analyzing  factors that lead students to drop out of university, we focused on the  career/work domain (see page 3). It assesses three dimensions or  components (motivational, cognitive, and behavioral) of the FO  construct in the domains of career/work and family. The 35 items  included in the questionnaire collect information using either  semantic differential or Likert-type scales (1   =   never   or   definitively  does not describe me   and 5   =   daily   or   definitively describes me ). The  motivational component is integrated by value, expectance, and  internal   control   (16   items;   example   of   item:   Considering   the  materialization of my career plans, I am optimistic ). The cognitive  component or cognitive representation refers to future hopes and fears  (7 items; example of item:   Thinking about your future career, how often  does your education make you think hopefully about it? ). Finally, the  behavioral component consists of exploration and commitment (12  items;   Header: Which of the following things have you been doing now  to get you closer to realizing your career plans? ... “Talking to people”;  “Collecting information” ). Items have the same structure but different  content according to each domain (work/career or family).  Seginer   (2009)   proposed   a   psychometrically   supported  measurement model of future orientation for Israeli adolescents and  students. Nevertheless, in a sample of 354 psychology students from  three   private   universities   in   Lima,   Peru,   the   questionnaire’s  psychometric properties were only partially supported ( Herrera et al.,  2024 ). In Peruvian samples, reliabilities for the factors have ranged  from 0.62 to 0.90; but the hierarchical factor structure proposed in  Seginer (2009)   was not replicated. It is likely that cultural differences  between   Israeli   and   Peruvian   youths   could   explain   the  differences in fit.  In the present study, a hierarchical model did not converge, either.  Thus, we fit a seven-factor model for the lower order dimensions or  subscales which fit adequately to the data ( χ 2   =   2462.964, df   =   573,  p   <   0.001, CFI   =   0.976, RMSEA =0.074, SRMR   =   0.070). All factor  loadings were significant ( p   <   0.001), except for one item in the  exploration scale. Reliability for the seven subscales was satisfactory:  value (0.85), expectance (0.84), internal control (0.86), hopes (0.78),  fears (0.83), exploration (0.70), and commitment (0.84).  2.2.3 Transitions from education to  employment-TREE  To assess the intention to abandon university studies, evidence  reported by   Findeisen et al. (2024)   was considered, as it has been  shown to be a reliable predictor of university attrition. Therefore, this  instrument created by   Stalder et al. (2011)   measures dropout intention  in higher education using 1 item. (i.e.,   What do you generally think of  your education lately: As soon as I find something better, I will change  my education/apprenticeship ) It was rated on a scale from 1 (hardly  ever) to 7 (almost always). Three expert judges (psychologists with  fluency in English) independently validated the item’s Spanish  translation. Unanimity for the new version was declared when the new  item was:   En este año académico, ¿qué es lo que usualmente piensas  acerca de tus estudios?: Tan pronto encuentre algo mejor, dejaré de  estudiar y me dedicaré a lo otro.  2.2.4 Grade point average (GPA) and tutoring  programme  GPA consisted of self-reporting the average score from the previous  semester to the current one, which ranges from 0 to 20 points. The  presence of tutoring programmes was checked on the participant  universities’ websites, so that if there was an active tutoring address or  office, the student was assumed to have access to this service.  2.3 Procedure  We carried out data collection online during two semesters. The  first was between March and July, 2022; 7 universities were contacted,  3 in the coastal region (2 private, 1 public), 2 in the highlands (1  private, 1 public) and 2 in the rainforest region (2 public). The second  was between August and November, 2022; five universities were  contacted, all public: 2 in the coast, 1 in the highlands and 2 in the  rainforest region. After requesting consent, a total of nine universities  sent the virtual questionnaires via Qualtrics, between the start of  classes and the week of mid-term exams.  2.4 Data analysis  We tested our theoretical model through structural equation  modeling, using lavaan version 0.6.15 ( Rosseel, 2012 ). We used robust  maximum likelihood to estimate model parameters. Our model  includes a latent variable for protective factors and for the motivational  and behavioral components of future orientation. Due to convergence  issues, we were unable to model the cognitive component of future  orientation as a latent variable, and opted instead for modeling hopes  and fears as observed variables, as shown in   Figure 1 . We used   t -tests  and ANOVA for ancillary analyses comparing study variables by  demographic subgroups. For sex analysis, participants who did not  report their sex ( n   =   6) were excluded given the small size of the group.  This study was not pre-registered. The raw data from this study  can be shared with interested scholars who request them from the  corresponding author.

Herrera et al.   10.3389/feduc.2024.1476426  Frontiers in   Education   06   frontiersin.org  3 Results  As shown in   Table 1 , the two dimensions that indicate resilience  (cognitive-individual and interpersonal) were mainly positively  correlated with the subcomponents of future orientation. Meanwhile,  students’ GPA, the dimensions of resilience, and almost all future  orientation   variables   except   exploration   were   negatively   and  significantly correlated with dropout intention. These results suggest  that students who are high achievers, score higher on future  orientation   dimensions,   and   prioritize   factors   contributing   to  resilience are less likely to consider dropping out of university.  However, fears were positively correlated with the intention to  abandon their studies.  As shown in   Figure 3 , we fit a structural equation model to our  data. The model fit reasonably well ( χ 2   =   232.273, df   =   72,   p   <   0.001,  CFI   =   0.926, RMSEA   =   0.069, SRMR   =   0.052). All factor loadings  were significant ( p s   <   0.001) and ranged between 0.46 and 0.93. The  motivational component of future orientation (including the three  empirical variables: value, expectance and internal control) was  positively preceded by the cognitive-individual and interpersonal  dimensions that indicate resilience ( β   =   0.61,   p   <   0.001), but not by  students’ GPA ( β   =   0.06,   p   =   0.133) nor by the existence of a tutoring  programme at the university ( β   =   0.04,   p   =   0.315). As predicted by the  future orientation model, motivation positively predicted hopes  ( β   =   0.62,   p   <   0.001), negatively predicted fears ( β   =   − 0.13,   p   =   0.002),  and   positively   predicted   the   behavioral   component   of   future  orientation ( β   =   0.96,   p   <   0.001). Hopes and fears did not predict the  behavioral component of future orientation once motivation was  accounted for ( β   =   0.00 and 0.00,   p s   =   0.953 and 0.953, respectively).  However, students with higher levels of the behavioral component of  future orientation had lower dropout intention ( β   =   − 0.38,   p   <   0.001).  This   provides   evidence   for   future   orientation   mediating   the  relationship between the dimensions that contribute to resilience and  dropout intentions.  3.1 Sex differences in the structural  parameter estimates  Because we   found significant differences between our study  variables by sex, we evaluated our model’s invariance to that variable.  Specifically, we compared configural invariance (the structure of the  model is the same across groups, but all parameters are freely  estimated by sex), metric invariance (factor loadings are constrained  to be equal across groups), scalar invariance (means are constrained  to be equal across groups), and structural invariance (regression paths  are also constrained to be equal across groups). As shown in   Table 2 ,  models fit separately for male and female students had the same factor  loadings,   but   different   means   and   regression   weights.   See  Supplementary Table S1   for details on the means and regression  weights by sex.  3.2 Secondary analyses  We tested differences in the study variables by demographic  subgroups. Consistent with previous research findings ( Goldin et al.,  2006 ;   Reeves and Smith, 2021 ), which reveal better performance in  academic settings for women than for men, we found that male  students’ dropout intentions ( d   =   0.27,   t   =   3.07,   p   =   0.002) were higher  than female students’. In addition, we found that students in private  universities had higher levels of value (future orientation, motivation  subscale,   d   =   0.22,   t   =   2.56,   p   =   0.011) than students in public  universities. The latter group had higher levels of social skills  ( d   =   − 0.20,   t   =   − 2.57,   p   =   0.011), goal-efficacy ( d   =   − 0.23,   t   =   − 2.94,  p   =   0.003), and hopes ( d   =   − 0.21,   t   =   − 2.47,   p   =   0.014). These results  contrast with long-standing stereotypes about public university  students ( Barreda-Parra et al., 2022 ;   Chowdhury, 2006 ;   De Feyter  et al., 2012 ;   Komarraju et al., 2011 ).  When comparing full-time students with students who also  worked, the latter had higher dropout intentions ( d   =   0.25,   t   =   3.06,  p   =   0.002), and lower social support ( d   =   − 0.16,   t   =   − 2.10,   p   =   0.036);  but higher social skills ( d   =   0.34,   t   =   4.34,   p   <   0.001), future planning  ( d   =   0.19,   t   =   2.49,   p   =   0.013),   goal-efficacy   ( d   =   0.17,   t   =   2.21,  p   =   0.027), expectance (future orientation, motivation subscale,  d   =   0.25,   t   =   3.14,   p   =   0.002), hopes (future orientation, cognitive  subscale,   d   =   0.27,   t   =   3.27,   p   =   0.001), and exploration (future  orientation, behavior subscale,   d   =   0.17,   t   =   2.11,   p   =   0.035). It is  noteworthy that students in the humanities had higher dropout  intentions compared to students in health-related careers ( d   =   0.62,  t   =   4.37,   p   =   0.002). Our findings provide preliminary evidence that  these   variables   diverge   significantly   between  demographic characteristics.  However, interactions between sex and career were not predictive  of dropout intentions (i.e., all interaction terms in a predictive model  of dropout intentions based on sex and career were non-significant).  In other words, men were more likely to have higher dropout  intentions than women, regardless of their field of study. All   p -values  were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamini-  Hochberg   correction.   For   additional   details   regarding  sociodemographic differences (see   Supplementary Table S2 ).  4 Discussion  This study examined how psychological factors favoring resilience,  as well as students’ GPA and tutoring programmes, indirectly  influence dropout intentions via future orientation among students in  Peru. We found that students who scored higher on the variables that  favor resilience (social support, social skills, future planning, and goal-  efficacy) and reported a clear and positive future orientation were less  likely to consider dropping out.  Our findings reaffirm the crucial role of factors that favor  resilience in preventing student dropout. Previous studies have  reported similar results ( Altharman et al., 2023 ;   Pertegal-Felices et al.,  2022 ). Nevertheless, our research provides evidence of a distinct  relationship emerging from the examination of factors that contribute  to resilience, extending beyond resilience as a trait.
