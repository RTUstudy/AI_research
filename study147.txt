dropout can be elucidated by six factors: societal expec -  tations, economic factors, program requirements, insti -  tutional factors, students’ academic performance, and students’ personal attitudes. Collectively, these six fac -  tors account for 73% of the variance in the data (Field, 2018). These findings substantiate Study Proposition 2 and align with existing literature (see, for example, Al Abdulrazaq et al., 2022; Fortin et al., 2006; Razouki et al., 2019). However, delving into how STEM and PAM students experience dropout requires further explora -  tion. To address this question, a two-way ANOVA ana -  lysis was conducted (refer to Table 6).  The results presented in Table 5 yield valuable insights. Among the six factors identified through Exploratory Factor   Analysis   (EFA),   only   one   factor   exhibits a significant difference between STEM and PAM stu -  dents. Social expectations appear to influence students in   both   major   groups   (p-value   <0.003,   η 2   = 0.12), indicating that society expects STEM graduates to achieve or accomplish more (mean = 4.72, 95% CI = [4.65, 4.79], St. Dev. = 0.237) than what PAM students are expected to do (mean = 4.03, 95% CI = [3.97, 4.09], St. Dev. = 0.184). This finding challenges the common perception that STEM and social sciences (PAM) students undergo dis -  parate experiences both within and outside the university (see, for example, Casanova et al., 2023; Mestan, 2016). Moreover, these results affirm the notion that university students, regardless of their majors, not only share the same geographical location but also seem to encounter similar economic, institutional, personal, and academic factors. For policymakers, these findings hold significance as they underscore the importance of approaching higher education reform uniformly across all majors, emphasiz -  ing enhancements in students’ university experiences irrespective of major specificity. The effect sizes (η 2 ) for the remaining factors ranged from 0.07 to 0.11, indicating  Figure 2.   Changing majors and/or university.  Figure 3.

Factors Affecting University Dropout: Comparison of STEM and Public Affairs and Management Students  Abdulfattah Yaghi   and Nizar Alabed  Government and Society, United Arab Emirates University, Al Ain, United Arab Emirates  ABSTRACT  University dropout poses significant challenges. This study examines factors influencing students’ decisions to discontinue university education without obtaining a bachelor’s degree. A survey was administered to 411 students in Public Affairs and Management (PAM) programs and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) programs at two large universities in the United Arab Emirates (2022–2023). Key findings reveal that only 27.4% of PAM students and 27.5% of STEM students never considered quitting, and approximately 64% of all students remained committed to their majors. Six factors—society’s expectations, economic factors, program require -  ments, institutional considerations, academic performance, and personal attitude—influence dropout decisions. Notably, no significant differences were observed between PAM and STEM students, except in their interaction with societal expectations. The study emphasizes the need for policies to enhance the overall university experience, promoting retention across majors.  KEYWORDS  Students; dropout; STEM; public affairs; university  Introduction and background  The diminishing commitment of male university students to complete their degrees poses an escalating challenge for parents, decision-makers, and educators. Despite a higher enrollment rate of female students in universities, male students constitute a dwindling minority (Gulftoday, 2021). Even though university education is freely accessible to all citizens (Emiratis or locals) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), not all students, particularly males, seize this opportunity. Various challenges impede their motiva -  tion to persist in college until graduation (Engin & McKeown, 2017; Gulfnews, 2021).  This study aims to identify and compare the factors influencing   dropout   intentions   among   students   in Science,   Technology,   Engineering,   and   Mathematics (STEM) and Public Affairs and Management (PAM) pro -  grams. By examining these factors, the research seeks to provide actionable insights for policymakers and educators to address dropout rates, particularly among male stu -  dents, who are disproportionately affected. The study focuses on six key factors derived from the pull-push and falling-out theory (Doll et al., 2013): societal expectations, economic challenges, program requirements, institutional factors, academic performance, and personal attitudes. These factors were selected based on their prominence in existing literature and their relevance to the UAE context, where demographic imbalances and cultural pressures uniquely shape students’ educational experiences.  Comparative research on student dropout rates in STEM versus PAM is sparse. STEM and PAM are pivo -  tal fields of study, producing professionals vital to both the public and private sectors (Ridge, 2009; Yaghi & Bates,   2023).   Additionally,   these   majors   attract a substantial number of students, making dropout see -  mingly incongruent with their popularity. Existing research has primarily focused on STEM without com -  prehensive comparisons with other prevalent majors in management, law, and other social sciences (Ridge et al., 2013; Salim, 2019; Tabrizi, 2013; Wilkins, 2010).  Despite the widespread appeal of STEM and PAM programs, dropout rates raise significant concerns among stakeholders, including decision-makers, par -  ents, and educators. While concerns about STEM drop -  out are extensively discussed, the same level of attention is not accorded to PAM. However, the limited research on this subject exacerbates these concerns, introducing ambiguity to the underlying factors behind student dropout across majors. The present study is an integral part of a larger project on students’ experiences in the UAE, focusing solely on reporting findings related to dropout intentions in PAM and STEM majors. This project, distinguished by its unique scope, aims to address various interrelated issues.

small-to-medium practical significance, while the confi -  dence intervals provide a robust estimate of the true population means for each factor.  To present a comprehensive view of dropout, Table 5 provides the descriptive statistics of the survey items. According to Table 5, the mean scores of the survey items were above 2.5 out of 5.0, except for seven items, indicating that students generally agreed with the survey questions. This supports the argument that the intention to dropout is complex, with students facing multiple obstacles affecting their retention (Fourie, 2020; Hailat et al., 2022). However, mean values alone may not suffice to fully elucidate dropout and test the study’s proposi -  tions. Hence, after confirming the dataset’s suitability for advanced analysis, an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was conducted (see Table 4). The results from KMO and Bartlett’s test (0.87 and   p   < 0.001, respectively) indicate that the data are suitable for EFA (Field, 2018). Following varimax rotation, the six extracted factors account for a cumulative percentage of variance of 78.5%, as indicated by the rotation sums of squared loadings.  The emerging factors in Table 4 reflect the survey items that are loaded on each factor, namely (1) family and society, (2) economic, (3) program and curriculum, (4) institutional, (5) academic perfor -  mance of the student, and (6) personal attitude. These factors confirm the complex nature of the dropout phenomenon and also align with previous findings by several researchers, such as Hailat et al. (2022),   Chaudhary   (2013),   Nicoletti   (2019),   and Mouton   et   al.   (2020),   who   reported   significant links between dropout and other factors.  While some researchers have emphasized the impor -  tance of STEM over other majors, this study provides evidence that STEM and PAM students experience simi -  lar university experiences. The only area that this study found a significant difference between the two groups is the expectations of their society. The findings offer empirical evidence concerning the role of pull, push, and falling out in shaping students’ university experience (Doll et al., 2013). The six factors that were found influ -  ential indicate that policymakers cannot solve dropout by simply implementing one policy or looking at one aspect of the problem. Instead, they can implement several poli -  cies that address social, economic, personal, and institu -  tional factors. To eradicate pull, push, and falling-out factors, there will be a need for a comprehensive approach in which various policies work simultaneously to reduce the negative impact of those factors.  Conclusion  The findings of this study reveal that dropout inten -  tions among PAM and STEM students are influenced by a complex interplay of factors, aligning with the pull-push and falling-out theory (Doll et al., 2013). The negligible differences between PAM and STEM students   challenge   the   common   assumption   that STEM students face unique challenges compared to their peers in social sciences (Casanova et al., 2023; Mestan, 2016). Instead, the results suggest that drop -  out factors are more universal, driven by broader institutional, societal, and personal pressures. The findings align with prior research highlighting the multifaceted nature of dropout. For instance, the role of economic challenges as a significant factor mirrors studies by Aina et al. (2013) and Hailat et al. (2022), who identified financial constraints as the  Figure 4.   Frequency of thinking about quitting.  INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION   9

of this study will delve into the country’s contextual backdrop, theoretical frameworks and literature, meth -  odologies employed, and the subsequent findings and discussions.  The novelty of this paper lies in its unique focus on comparing dropout intentions between STEM and PAM students, two critical yet understudied fields in many countries but particularly in the UAE. While existing research predominantly examines STEM drop -  out in isolation, this study provides a comprehensive comparative analysis, uncovering similarities and differ -  ences   in   dropout   factors   across   these   disciplines. Additionally, the study integrates the pull-push and fall -  ing-out theory (Doll et al., 2013) to frame its analysis, offering a robust theoretical foundation that has not been extensively applied in the UAE and similar con -  texts. By addressing the demographic imbalance and cultural pressures unique to the UAE, this research contributes fresh insights into how universal dropout factors   manifest   in   a   region-specific   setting. Furthermore, the study’s findings challenge the assump -  tion that STEM students face unique challenges, high -  lighting the universality of dropout factors across disciplines, which has significant implications for theory building, policymaking decisions, and educators role.  Country context  The implications of dropout in the UAE, as well as in comparable countries, are profound. The UAE grapples with a longstanding demographic imbalance, where local citizens constitute a mere minority within their own country, making up around one-tenth of the total population (Al Kaabi, 2016; Yaghi, 2016; Yaghi & Bates, 2023). This preexisting issue amplifies the country’s pressing need for locally educated graduates. Notably, the government expresses particular concern about the disproportionately low number of male graduates, who account for less than 35% of the total graduates from higher education. In contrast, dropout rates among female students across all majors are noticeably lower (Abdulla & Ridge, 2010; Al Kaabi, 2016).  Several studies have illuminated dropout rates for males and females in high school in the UAE, indicating rates   of   20–25%   for   males   and   14%   for   females (Edarabia, 2013). Chaudhary (2013), citing Zureik (2005), reported a dropout rate of 35% among boys in grades 10 to 12, compared to 25% among girls in the same   years.   Nasir   (2017)   quoted   the   Minister   of Education, highlighting a 14% dropout rate for univer -  sity students, although the accuracy of this figure remains uncertain due to limited scientific research on tertiary education dropout (Alkaabi & Noor, 2020; Ashour, 2020a, 2020b). Regrettably, most local studies and reports did not distinguish between dropout rates in high schools and universities, potentially obscuring the true extent of the issue (Bridi & Al Hosani, 2022; Chaudhary, 2013). Furthermore, these studies did not delve into the dropout phenomenon among university students, further complicating the understanding of dropout in higher education. Despite the implementa -  tion of several federal government policies aimed at ensuring an adequate supply of an educated local work -  force and a reasonable reduction in dropout, especially among males constituting less than 30% of all university students (Said & A, 2013; Yaghi & Bates, 2023), govern -  ment intervention has not yet effectively eliminated or significantly reduced dropout numbers (Nasir, 2017).  Previous research findings indicate that dropout, in general, is associated with various factors, including students’ lack of interest in academic life, poor academic performance, low grades, excessive absences and tardi -  ness,   on-campus   misconduct,   repeated   changes   of schools, and changes in college majors (Ashour, 2020b; Hassock & Hill, 2022; Krstić et al., 2017; Parahoo et al., 2013). The persistent occurrence of this phenomenon, especially among males, necessitates a closer examina -  tion of these factors within the UAE context. The UAE’s case is significant for multiple reasons; it is one of the few countries grappling with a deeply rooted demo -  graphic imbalance. Even before independence and the unification of the seven emirates, expatriates constituted a substantial portion of the UAE population (Ashour, 2020a; Wilkins et al., 2012). As the UAE embraces a free-market approach, the government faces the chal -  lenge of balancing its flourishing economy, heavily reli -  ant on foreign human labor, with its obligation to cultivate a national capacity based on locally trained and well-qualified individuals, particularly university graduates. Government intervention appears to be a top national priority, as evidenced by the 70-year plan,   a   long-term   national   development   strategy, which lists the training and qualification of local human capital as a top priority (Ashour, 2020b; Yaghi & Bates, 2023).  Theory and literature  This literature review section delves into the pull, push, and falling-out theory, elucidating the multifaceted fac -  tors associated with dropout, encompassing social mal -  adjustment, behavioral disorders, delinquency, socio- economic variables, academic advising, registration dif -  ficulties, work responsibilities, health status, anxiety, uncertainty, isolation, alienation, academic challenges, teaching methodologies, teacher attitudes, attendance,  2   A.

motivation, interest, goal setting, expectations, engage -  ment,   social   support,   and   economic   challenges (Archambault   et   al.,   2022;   Bäulke   et   al.,   2022). Additionally, it conducts a comparative analysis of find -  ings from different countries and contexts to identify commonalities.  Pull-push and falling-out theory  The pull-push and falling-out theory, articulated by Doll et al. (2013), delineates three distinct groups of factors influencing the decision to drop out of school: push factors, pull factors, and falling-out factors. Push factors encompass elements within the school environment that contribute to a negative experience for the students, such as strained relationships with teachers, inadequate school infrastructure, testing policies, and attendance requirements (Jordan et al., 1994). Pull factors, identi -  fied by Jordan et al. (1994), involve external forces attracting or compelling students to leave, including family-related issues, recruitment by job agencies, eco -  nomic pressures, social challenges, and disabilities. Falling out of school pertains to factors intrinsic to the students themselves, such as a lack of interest in learn -  ing, negative attitudes, aggressive behavior, and poor academic   performance   (Doll et   al., 2013; Watt   & Roessingh, 1994).  While push, pull, and falling-out factors are inter -  connected, they exert distinct effects on dropout, with the agency factor serving as a distinguishing element (Alhassan & Hassan, 2024). Doll et al. (2013, p. 2) clarify that the school is the agent in push-out factors, society is the agent in pull-out factors, and individual students are the agents in falling-out factors. This distinction is cru -  cial in shaping public policy interventions to reduce dropout, as targeted efforts should address the specific components where push-out, pull-out, and falling-out factors manifest. However, regardless of the agent involved in the causes of dropout, the crux of the issue remains the student’s disengagement with the school. Push, pull, and falling-out factors, often overlapping, pose a challenge for policymakers in determining where intervention efforts should commence (Finn, 1993; Yaghi et al., 2007). Lehr et al. (2004) underscore that disengagement constitutes the fundamental beha -  vior leading to dropout, as students decide to leave school due to a sense of not belonging. Events occurring before or after disengagement may extend beyond the direct control of policymakers. Disengagement is asso -  ciated with specific problems, which, according to Lehr et al. (2004) and Finn (1993), include constant student withdrawals, unusual school experiences, a poor sense of belonging, and a general dislike for school. These factors collectively contribute to the challenging reality of   reversing   student   disengagement   (Finn,   1993). Student engagement in school, therefore, becomes a pivotal aspect of their successful completion; when students are engaged on psychological, social, and aca -  demic levels, they are more likely to complete their studies and graduate.  Relevant literature  Dropout in higher education is a multifaceted issue influenced by a combination of individual, institutional, and socio-economic factors. Previous research has iden -  tified a wide range of factors that fit within the pull, push, and falling-out framework (Pasha-Zaidi & Afari, 2016). A comprehensive review of existing studies underscores three key findings: (a) dropout is influ -  enced by a multitude of factors; (b) the UAE shares several factors influencing dropout with other countries; and (c) empirical studies substantiate the assertions of major theories discussed earlier. The ensuing discussion spotlights select studies closely aligned with the scope of this research.  Socio-economic and institutional factors  Aina, Baici, Casalone, and Pastore (2022) emphasized the role of financial constraints, family income levels, and labor market influences on dropout. Their find -  ings reveal that students from low-income families are particularly vulnerable to dropout due to economic pressures, while the availability of academic support services   and   scholarship   programs   significantly enhances   retention   rates.   Similarly,   Hailat   et   al. (2022) investigated push-pull factors influencing stu -  dent selection of higher education among Arabian Gulf students in the UK. Their findings reveal that economic pressures and institutional factors signifi -  cantly impact dropout decisions, particularly among students balancing familial expectations and financial responsibilities. This study provides valuable insights into how cultural and economic factors intersect to influence student retention. In the UAE, Alkaabi and Noor (2023) explored the factors contributing to stu -  dent dropout in public secondary schools using qua -  litative interviews and thematic analysis. The study identified   socioeconomic   status,   family   dynamics, and community involvement as key factors influen -  cing student retention. The findings reveal that drop -  out is a multifaceted issue, with at-risk students often facing challenges such as financial constraints, lack of familial support, and disengagement from the educa -  tional process.

Disciplinary perspectives: STEM and PAPS  In   the   context   of   STEM   education,   Casanova, Vasconcelos,   Casanova   et   al.   (2021)   explored   the motives and trajectories of university dropout among engineering students, identifying academic challenges, lack of motivation, and mismatched expectations as primary drivers. Their study reveals that students who struggle with the demanding curriculum of engineering programs or feel disconnected from their chosen field are more likely to drop out, especially when institutional support, such as academic advising and mentoring, is lacking. Casanova et al. (2021) assert that age, gender, scholarship status, and grade point average significantly impacted students’ adaptation to higher education, aca -  demic achievement, and dropout decisions. The results highlight the importance of addressing academic diffi -  culties and providing institutional support to enhance student persistence, particularly during the critical first year.  In the field of public affairs and political science (PAPS), Yaghi (2024) investigates the factors influen -  cing dropout among at-risk graduate and undergradu -  ate students. The study identifies six key factors driving graduate student dropout: financial burdens (e.g., tui -  tion costs and limited financial aid), program-related challenges (e.g., rigorous thesis requirements and lack of practical components), balancing multiple responsibil -  ities (e.g., work, study, and family), health issues (e.g., anxiety and stress), poor academic performance, and personal difficulties (e.g., lack of family support). At the undergraduate level, factors that pushed students out included family and societal influences, economic considerations,   program   structure,   institutional dynamics, academic performance, personal attitudes, and personal health.  Regional and cultural contexts  In the Gulf region, Ridge et al. (2013) and Patterson et al. (2021) discussed the gender gap in basic, secondary, and post-secondary education, where male students consti -  tute less than half the number of female students. These studies report on many possible causes of the sharp decline in male numbers, such as social factors related to the family, economic factors related to supporting the family at an early age, personal factors due to students’ inability to keep up with their study requirements, and policy-related factors as some legislations need more improvements to ensure more male students remain in school until graduation. In other regions, Sangeetha (2021) found that low-income, poor academic perfor -  mance, and personal factors such as lack of interest and health problems influenced STEM student dropout in Oman. In Saudi Arabia, Al Abdulrazaq et al. (2022) identified absenteeism, lack of educational goals, the need for employment, and a perceived diminished value of   academic   degrees   as   predictors   of   dropout.   In Morocco, Razouki et al. (2019) reported dropout rates between 28% and 30% among first- and second-year university students, with factors like health status, anxi -  ety, academic challenges, inadequate teaching methodol -  ogies, and alienation contributing significantly.  Global perspectives and theoretical frameworks  On a broader scale, Véliz Palomino and Ortega (2023) conducted a systematic literature review of predictors of dropout intentions in higher education, analyzing scien -  tific production in Q1 and Q2 journals from 2018 to 2023. The study highlights the critical issue of college dropout, emphasizing its economic and social costs. The review identifies two primary categories of predictors: (1) psychological factors, such as motivation and mental health and (2) academic and social integration factors, including institutional support and peer relationships. The findings underscore the multifaceted nature of dropout intentions, driven by a combination of indivi -  dual, institutional, and contextual factors. Similarly, Arias et al. (2024) conducted a systematic literature review of undergraduate dropout in Colombia, analyz -  ing 107 studies published between 2000 and 2021. Key causes of dropout include academic, economic, and institutional   factors,   while   the   proposed   solutions emphasize the use of data science and early intervention strategies. However, the study highlights a lack of inte -  gration among stakeholders and insufficient detail in the implementation and impact of the proposed solu -  tions,   making   it   challenging   to   design   effective strategies.  The literature highlights striking similarities in dropout factors across diverse countries, suggesting that dropout is increasingly a global concern (Fortin et al., 2006; Smith & Yang, 2017). Factors such as academic advising, registration issues, engagement, social support, learning difficulties, lack of motiva -  tion, and economic challenges were found to be common predictors in various international contexts (Smith & Yang, 2017). These findings indicate that while the factors influencing student dropout are similar across countries, their impact might differ based on cultural and institutional contexts. Despite extensive research, the literature reveals an intricate web of factors influencing dropout, lacking a clear distinction between universal and context-specific  4   A. YAGHI AND N. ALABED

The study was conducted in strict adherence to ethical guidelines and received approval from the University’s ethical review board. Informed consent was obtained from all participants before they com -  pleted the survey. Participants were provided with a detailed explanation of the study’s purpose, the voluntary nature of their participation, and their right   to   withdraw   at   any   time   without   penalty. Confidentiality   and   anonymity   were   ensured   by omitting   personally identifiable information   from the survey responses. Data were stored securely and accessed only by the research team for analysis pur -  poses. These measures were implemented to protect participants’ rights and ensure the integrity of the research process.  The research team utilized a drop-off, pick-up method to collect completed surveys (Allred & Ross- Davis, 2011; Jackson-Smith et al., 2016). Identifying undergraduate students who dropped out presented challenges due to outdated addresses or universities withholding relevant information. Consequently, the survey included questions about students’ “intention” to drop out, encompassing those with low GPAs, multiple dropped courses, major changes, suspen -  sions, or behavioral issues. Previous research sup -  ports assessing “intention” as a valid measure of students’   dropout   behavior   (Astin,   1975;   Fourie, 2020;   Morelli   et   al.,   2023;   Mostert   et   al.,   2023; Pascarella & Terenzini, 1980).  To ensure survey validity, the researchers adminis -  tered it to a convenience sample of 1,739 STEM and PAM students. However, surveys where respondents answered “No” to any of the three introductory ques -  tions were excluded from further analysis. This exclu -  sion was necessary because these students did not meet the criteria for being at risk of dropping out. As a result, 411 surveys were included in the final analysis. These surveys exhibited acceptable reliability, as indicated by a Cronbach’s Alpha measure of α = 0.877 (McNeish, 2018). While the sample size is sufficient for statistical analysis, it is important to note that the convenience sampling approach and the exclusion criteria may limit the representativeness of the findings. Specifically, the sample primarily reflects the experiences of students at two large universities in the UAE, which may not fully capture the diversity of student populations in other regions or institutions. Consequently, the generalizabil -  ity of the findings to broader contexts should be inter -  preted with caution. Future studies are encouraged to expand the sample size, include a wider range of institu -  tions, and incorporate students from diverse academic and cultural backgrounds to enhance the external valid -  ity of the results.  Findings and discussion  Description of the study sample  This section provides an overview of the study sample as a unified group without distinguishing between STEM and PAM students, as demographic characteristics do not necessarily have analytical implications beyond sample description. Table 1 reveals that 77% of the undergraduate students are aged 19 to 22, with 21% between 23 and 26. Like most other majors, the majority of students (57%) are female, single (92%), hail from middle-class families (71%), and have both parents alive (98%). Furthermore, Table 1 indicates that most stu -  dents (73%) come from families with 3−5 siblings, and around 69.5% have one parent employed.  Table 1 indicates that a significant proportion of students have educated parents, with 71.5% having a mother with a bachelor’s degree and 75.6% having a father with the same degree. Perhaps due to their education, a higher percentage of parents (65%) appear to engage in discussions about academic life with their children, although about one-third (34.7%) of all stu -  dents reported that their parents “rarely” discuss their academic life. Regarding parental involvement in major selection, approximately half of the students (48%) indi -  cated that their parents did not interfere, while around a quarter indicated the opposite. Health issues emerge as a notable factor in students’ university life, with about 41% reporting health concerns ranging from severe to moderate, while the majority (55%) did not express such concerns. A significant proportion of students (82%) did not have a disability, but around 17% reported some form of disability, ranging from a severe (4%) to a minimal (7%). Regarding mental health, approxi -  mately 42% of the students indicated experiencing men -  tal health issues, with occurrences ranging from always (5%) to often (10%) and sometimes (27%), while the majority (57%) did not report anxiety, depression, or stress.  To compare the university experiences of PAM and STEM students, Table 2 substantiates proposition 3 of the study, revealing negligible and relatively minor dif -  ferences in the attitudes of PAM and STEM students. For instance, among students who changed their major or university several times, 48% were PAM students and 52% were STEM students. Similarly, among those who never changed their major or university, 49% were PAM students, and 51% were STEM students. Notably, atti -  tudes toward changing majors or dropping out were remarkably similar, with only slight variations between PAM and STEM students.  As proposed by the study (propositions 1 and 3), students in both major areas express very similar  6   A. YAGHI AND N. ALABED

attitudes. Analyzing each major group individually, Table 2 demonstrates that 27.4% of PAM students com -  pared to 27.5% of STEM students never thought about dropping out. Moreover, 18.7% of PAM students, com -  pared to 16.3% of STEM students, reported thinking very often about dropping out of the university. In terms of the intention to change the current major, 12% of PAM students compared to 13.6% of STEM students expressed such thoughts. Additionally, 36% of PAM students and 37.5% of STEM students reported never contemplating changing their current major. Even when asked about actually changing their major or university, 11% of PAM students and 11.3% of STEM students indicated having done so several times. Among those who never changed their major or university, 64.5% were PAM students compared to 62.5% of STEM students (see, Figures 2–4).  Based on the above findings and discussion, dropout and changing majors among all students did not vary significantly regardless of their major. These findings underscore the seriousness of dropout challenges for various stakeholders, indicating a lack of strong com -  mitment among students to remain in their current major or university until graduation. Decision-makers in higher education should express concern about the percentages reported in Table 2, as the low percentages of students who never changed their majors, never con -  templated changing their major, and never considered dropping out are alarming. These findings suggest a fragile and unstable academic situation for students. Notably, the high intentions to drop out warrant- specific   policy   attention,   despite   dropout   being a global issue among students from various majors (Gallagher, 2019). However, further analysis is required to   gain   a   deeper   understanding   of   the   dropout phenomenon.  Because the responses from both groups, PAM and STEM students, exhibited considerable similarity, it became necessary to treat both groups collectively and compute the aggregate mean values for all students’ responses to the survey items (refer to Table 3). The students revealed numerous challenges during their university studies, providing insights into an unstable and problematic campus experience. Within these responses, some reflect push factors, while others indi -  cate pull and falling factors. Notably, the majority of mean values surpassed 3.6, signifying agreement with the listed sentences (survey items). Consequently, we can infer that students generally concur with statements corresponding to pull, push, and falling factors. These findings align with existing literature emphasizing the intricate nature of dropout (Fourie, 2020; Hailat et al., 2022).  However, recognizing that these percentages may not offer a profound understanding of the data, we pro -  ceeded to conduct an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA). EFA facilitates the meaningful grouping of all survey items, providing a more nuanced perspective on the data (see Table 4).  Table 5 indicates that the Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) has identified six factors derived from the data (KMO and Bartlett’s test = 73.62%,   p   < 0.005). Utilizing principal component analysis as the extraction method with varimax rotation, the results unveil that students’  Table 2.   Indicators of intention to dropout among STEM and PAM students.

primary driver of dropout. Similarly, the importance of institutional support resonates with Casanova et al. (2021), who found that lack of academic advising and mentoring significantly impacts retention. However, this study extends the literature by demonstrating that these factors affect PAM and STEM students equally, challenging the notion that STEM students are uniquely vulnerable.  One notable finding is the significant role of societal expectations, particularly for STEM students, who reported higher pressure to achieve (mean = 4.72) com -  pared to PAM students (mean = 4.03).

factors   and   lacking   comparative   examinations   of dropout among various groups of the student body. Consequently,   this   study   constructed   the   model below (Figure 1) and proposes the following: (a) dropout intentions among PAM and STEM students are high (proposition 1), (b) six broad factors can predict dropout among PAM and STEM students: social expectations, personal attitude, personal aca -  demic performance, economic factors, institutional factors, and programmatic factors (proposition 2), and (c) these factors are expected to influence the dropout   decision   without   significant   differences between PAM and STEM students (proposition 3).  Methods  This study aims to explore the factors influencing stu -  dents’ dropout, comparing those majoring in STEM and PAM   at   two   universities   during   the   2022/2023 academic year (see Table 1). The combined enrollment of these universities exceeds 20,000 students at the grad -  uate and undergraduate levels. Following an extensive literature review and considering the UAE context, a survey was crafted to assess students’ intentions to drop out. The survey underwent two rounds of evaluation by a panel of three experts, resulting in a reliable survey instrument with a Cronbach’s Alpha of 0.863 upon pilot -  ing with 68 students (McNeish, 2018).

Ridge et al. (2013) and Patterson et al. (2021), who highlighted the cultural and societal pressures faced by students in the Gulf region. However, the lack of sig -  nificant differences in other factors, such as economic challenges and institutional support, suggests that these issues are pervasive across disciplines. This reinforces the need for a holistic approach to dropout prevention, as proposed by Fortin et al. (2006), who argue that addressing dropout requires simultaneous interventions across multiple domains.  The findings have significant implications for policy -  makers and university administrators. First, the uniformity of dropout factors across majors suggests that higher edu -  cation reforms should not be tailored to specific disciplines  Table 5.

but should instead focus on improving the overall student experience. For example, enhancing institutional support systems, such as academic advising and mental health services, could benefit all students regardless of their major. Second, the high societal expectations placed on STEM students highlight the need for targeted interven -  tions to alleviate pressure and provide career guidance. Finally, the economic challenges faced by students, as evidenced by the high mean scores for items related to financial strain, underscore the importance of expanding scholarship programs and financial aid.  While this study provides valuable insights into dropout factors, it is not without limitations. The sample, though substantial, is limited to students from specific majors and institutions, which may affect   the   generalizability   of   the   findings.   Future research should aim to include a more diverse and representative sample of students from multiple insti -  tutions and regions. Additionally, longitudinal studies could provide deeper insights into how dropout inten -  tions evolve over time and how interventions can be tailored to address these changes. Qualitative research could also complement the quantitative findings by exploring the lived experiences of students who con -  sider dropping out, offering a more nuanced under -  standing of the factors at play.  An important finding is the role of universities in enhancing a welcoming and supportive environment for all students. Institutions need to invest more resources in understanding the challenges students face, such as difficulties with registration, payments, and attendance. Policies aimed at improving student engagement and mental health (Yaghi, 2022) should be prioritized, alongside curriculum revisions to enhance the learning experience. Researchers are encouraged to expand com -  parisons beyond STEM and PAM to include other majors and increase sample sizes, ensuring a more diverse   and   representative   participant   pool. Understanding how students perceive the personal gains of their chosen major is critical, as dropout deci -  sions often involve a rational calculation of the benefits of obtaining a degree. Addressing these limitations and insights in the future research will provide a more com -  prehensive   understanding   of   dropout   factors   and inform   targeted   interventions   to   improve   student retention.
