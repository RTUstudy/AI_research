universities, and some of the findings are a decade old. Nevertheless, future studies, espe -  cially those focusing on PAPS students, are imperative to further explore these aspects. Following the analysis of findings from undergraduate data, the subsequent section of the study will concentrate on analyzing the responses of graduate students in PAPS.  Analyzing the responses of graduate dropouts  This study delved into the experiences of graduate students who had already dropped out, offering a unique perspective compared to surveys on undergraduate students’ intentions. The data, derived from 18 semi-structured interviews with graduate dropouts from different PAPS master’s programs in UAE universities, provide valuable insights into the reasons behind their decisions (Braun, Clarke, Hayfield, and Terry,   2019 ). Thematic analysis was conducted manually by performing the following tasks: familiarization with the responses to identify the main ideas, patterns, and meanings in the data; coding the responses; theme generating by reviewing all the codes, organizing them into broader themes and patterns, looking for connections, similarities, and differences among the codes and grouping them accordingly, and giving each theme a descriptive name that captures its essence; theme reviewing and development by checking if themes are coherent, consistent, and meaningful, and refining and revising themes by adding, removing, or merging them as needed in accordance to the propositions of the study; theme definition by providing a clear and con -  cise definition of each theme and explaining what it represents and how it reflects its core concept; and reporting by presenting the themes in a logical order and supporting them with evidence from the data, and discussing the implications, limitations, and contributions of the analysis (Castleberry and Nolen   2018 ; Braun and Clarke   2019 ). This analysis revealed six significant elements (themes) influencing dropout: (1) family and society, (2) economic, (3) program and curriculum, (4) institutional, (5) academic performance of the student, and (6) personal attitude. These elements are elaborated below and represented in   Figure 1 .  First: economic elements  Economic concerns emerged as crucial push forces for dropout, encompassing high pro -  gram costs, the inability to afford tuition fees, limited employment benefits relative to study expenses, and a scarcity of financial aid options. Many students faced the burden  Figure 1.   Elements influenced dropped out of PAPS graduate students.  16   A. YAGHI

of funding their education without employer support, leading to financial stress and eventual dropout.  Second: program curricular elements  Graduate dropouts cited various program-related challenges, including the inflexible curriculum lacking practical components, language barriers, daunting thesis require -  ments, and inadequate guidance (see, Yaghi and Alibeli   2014 ). The rigidity of the cur -  riculum, limited course options, and the emphasis on theoretical courses left many students dissatisfied. Language of instruction also played a role, with Arabic-speaking students feeling isolated and uncomfortable in English-taught classes. Additionally, the thesis requirements, both in terms of writing and defending proposals, proved daunting, leading some students to abandon their studies.  Third: balancing multiple responsibilities  Time constraints were a common theme among dropouts, with both universities and employers being inflexible, making it difficult for students to balance work, home, and study responsibilities. Students faced challenges attending classes due to work commit -  ments and found it overwhelming to juggle multiple roles without adequate support.  Fourth: health elements  Health-related issues, including psychological distress, anxiety, and pregnancy, posed significant barriers to academic focus and commitment. Some students reported feeling anxious and mentally unprepared for the demands of the program, leading them to reconsider their decision to pursue a master’s degree.  Fifth: academic performance  Poor academic performance, often reflected in low GPAs, further exacerbated students’ struggles. The difficulty of the coursework, particularly in areas like research methods and public administration theory, led to dissatisfaction and discouragement among stu -  dents, impacting their ability to continue.  Sixth: personal difficulties  Personal challenges, such as lack of family support, parental pressure, marital conflicts, or self-confidence issues, hindered students’ motivation and commitment. These per -  sonal struggles affected their overall university experience and made it challenging for them to persevere.  This qualitative analysis highlights that graduate and undergraduate students are influenced by similar forces, albeit experienced differently. While undergraduates did not face time management issues, balancing responsibilities became a significant con -  cern for graduate students. Additionally, universities and PAPS departments play a pivotal  JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION   17

role in shaping students’ experiences. Creating supportive environments, addressing finan -  cial concerns, and offering academic and social support are vital for student retention. Academic managers and institutions must collaborate to establish policies fostering a stu -  dent-centric culture, ensuring students’ success and degree completion. Future research should explore existing governance systems and policies within UAE higher education institutions to enhance PAPS students’ retention and graduation rates.  Conclusion and limitations  This study has delved into the intricate phenomenon of dropout among PAPS students, with the aim of shedding light on the complexities surrounding this issue. Through a thorough   exploration,   two   essential   propositions   were   scrutinized,   drawing   insights from both the survey administered to undergraduate students and the interviews con -  ducted with graduate students. The findings illuminate critical aspects of the dropout problem within PAPS programs, emphasizing the pivotal role that universities play in exacerbating this challenge.  As one of the few studies focusing on PAPS students, this research offers empirical evidence concerning the intricate nature of dropout. It also provides support for the arguments of two prominent theories: integration and engagement theory (Spady   1971 ; Tinto   2012 ) and pull, push, and falling out theory (Doll, Eslami, and Walters   2013 ). By doing this, the study demonstrates that these theories (a) can be applied to specific majors, including PAPS, providing a valid explanation of dropout in general and within a particular major; (b) since the findings from the UAE align with those from other contexts, both theories can be suitable to explain and predict dropout in different set -  tings; (c) dropout is a global phenomenon, influenced by forces such as family, eco -  nomic, personal, academic, and institutional factors that impact student retention in PAPS in the UAE, as well as students in other majors in different countries. However, it is crucial to replicate this study by surveying PAPS students and students from other majors within either the same country or a similar context for more accurate generaliza -  tion and comparison.  Based on the findings of this study, the average student who drops out of PAPS pro -  grams in the UAE is typically characterized by several key factors. These students often face significant personal and academic challenges, including balancing work, family, and academic responsibilities. They are usually full-time employees with limited time for academic pursuits, which exacerbates their struggle to keep up with the demands of their studies. Additionally, financial constraints and institutional rigidity, such as inflex -  ible class schedules and inadequate funding opportunities, further contribute to their decision to drop out.  The analysis provided here indicates that students at risk of dropping out are those who experience a combination of personal, academic, and financial pressures. To mitigate these risks, universities should consider implementing the following intervention strategies:  �   Flexible Scheduling: Offering more flexible class schedules and lecture timings to accommodate working students.  18   A.

Examining Dropout Among Graduate and Undergraduate Public Affairs and Political Science Students  Abdulfattah Yaghi  United Arab Emirates University  ABSTRACT  Within the domain of public affairs and political science (PAPS), stu -  dent dropout emerges as a critical concern. This study delves into the factors influencing the decisions of undergraduate and graduate PAPS students to discontinue their programs. Employing a compre -  hensive mixed-methods approach, we surveyed 384 at-risk under -  graduates   and   conducted   in-depth   interviews   with   18   former graduate students. Thematic analysis of these interviews revealed six pivotal factors influencing graduate student dropout: the financial burden of study (including tuition and limited financial aid), program curricular challenges (such as demanding thesis requirements and inadequate practical components), the delicate balance of multiple responsibilities   (work,   study,   and   family),   health-related   issues (including anxiety and stress), poor academic performance, and per -  sonal difficulties (such as lack of family support). At the undergradu -  ate level, descriptive analyses indicated that 38% of PAPS students contemplated dropping out, with 30% considering changing their major.   Exploratory   Factor   Analysis   and   Multiple   Regression   high -  lighted the significance of factors such as family and societal influen -  ces,   economic   considerations,   program   and   curriculum   structure, institutional   dynamics,   academic   performance,   personal   attitudes, and student health in shaping these contemplations. This research not only expands the application of integration and engagement theory and the pull, push, and failing out theory but also validates their effectiveness in predicting dropout within PAPS programs. The study offers valuable insights for both researchers and policymakers, underscoring the imperative for more supportive, flexible, and finan -  cially viable educational structures to enhance student retention in the realm of public affairs and political science.  ARTICLE HISTORY  Received 11 December 2023 Accepted 31 July 2024  KEYWORDS  Dropout; public affairs; university; UAE; students at risk  Introduction  Public Affairs and Political Science (PAPS) constitute a multifaceted field, encompassing disciplines such as public administration, public policy, public management, and polit -  ical science. PAPS programs are designed to prepare students for diverse careers, par -  ticularly in the public sector, enabling them to address complex societal issues (Rich  CONTACT   Abdulfattah   Yaghi   abdulfattah@uaeu.ac.ae,   ayaghi@gmail.com   Department   of   Government   and Society, United Arab Emirates University, P.O.

2013 ; Yaghi and Yaghi,   2023 ). Since the establishment of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), universities have offered PAPS programs, playing a pivotal role in graduating numerous public officials and senior decision-makers in the public sector (Hassock and Hill   2022a ; Al-Hummadi   2013 ; Zahran, Pettaway, and Waller   2016 ). However, despite the proliferation of higher education institutions offering PAPS degrees, a concerning dropout rate persists, particularly among male students (Gallagher   2019 ; Ashour   2020a ,  2020b ; Hassock and Hill   2022b ).  The dropout issue in PAPS programs warrants empirical investigation. The underly -  ing assumption is that an increase in PAPS program enrollment is positive, aligning with the programs’ goal of producing individuals trained to serve society and contribute value to various sectors. The author contends that stakeholders, including academic managers, government recruiting agencies, and parents, should grasp the specific nature of the dropout problem in PAPS (Yaghi,   2024 ; Marzec   2018 ; Rich   2013 ; Schultz   2016 ).  In   the   past   decade,   research   attention   has   predominantly   focused   on   Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) students rather than PAPS students. Furthermore, studies on the general topic of dropout in the Arab world, particularly in the UAE, are limited and often fail to distinguish between university or school dropout (Tabrizi   2013 ; Salim,   2019 ; Ridge, Farah, and Shami   2013 ; Wilkins   2010 ). Moreover, no research has specifically addressed dropout among PAPS students. This paper aims to address this gap in the literature and provide insights to program directors and institu -  tions on dropout prevention policies.  The significance of focusing on PAPS programs lies in their direct link to government work and the public sector. Many PAPS graduates enter public service, making dropout a concern as it depletes potential civil servants and sources of new talent (Bin Braik   2023 ; Yaghi and Yaghi   2023 ). PAPS programs cover essential topics affecting society’s well- being, government decisions, and policies (Haupt, Kapucu, and Hu   2017 ; Rich   2013 ; Yaghi and Alibeli   2014 ). Therefore, investigating dropout among PAPS students and iden -  tifying influencing factors is vital. Understanding these factors can enhance the quality and relevance of PAPS education, improve student retention and success, and provide interdisciplinary insights from other disciplines and contexts (Guzm � an, Salazar, and Parra  2021 ; Yaghi and Almutawwa   2023 ). This study contributes to advancing knowledge and innovation in PAPS education and research. The subsequent sections of this paper will delve into background and context, theory, relevant literature, methods, findings and dis -  cussion, analyzing the responses of graduate dropouts, conclusion, and limitations.  Background and context  This section provides essential background information and context for the problem of dropout in PAPS programs in the UAE. It discusses the prevalence, impact, and causes of dropout in general, as well as the significance and challenges of PAPS education in the UAE. Additionally, it identifies a gap in the literature on dropout among PAPS stu -  dents, a gap that this paper aims to fill.  The impact of dropout on the UAE, and similar countries, can be severe. The UAE has long grappled with a demographic imbalance where local citizens constitute only a minority within their own country, making up just around one-tenth of the total  2   A. YAGHI

Page 4:
population (Yaghi   2016 ; Yaghi and Yaghi   2023 ). This preexisting issue intensifies the country’s urgent need for locally educated graduates. Notably, the government is par -  ticularly concerned about the low numbers of male graduates, accounting for less than 35% of the total graduates from higher education. In contrast, dropout rates among female students across all majors are significantly lower (Al Kaabi   2016 ; Abdulla and Ridge   2010 ). The government is committed to reducing the dropout rate, particularly among male students, as a heightened attrition rate may necessitate the public sector’s increased recruitment of female nationals or expatriates of both genders. Such outcomes could exacerbate demographic imbalances, which is contrary to the desired objectives of the UAE’s human resource policies. These policies aim to cultivate a workforce that is proportionally equitable in gender representation and diverse in nationality. In 2011, the Emirates Center for Strategic Studies and Research highlighted that dropout rates for boys and girls in high school in the UAE stood at 20–25% and 14%, respectively (Edarabia.com, 2011). Chaudhary ( 2013 ) cited Zureik ( 2005 ) in reporting that the drop -  out rate in the UAE was 35% among boys in grades 10 to 12, compared to 25% among girls in the same years. Nasir ( 2017 ) quoted the Minister of Education, pointing out that the dropout rate for university students was 14%, although this figure was uncer -  tain due to limited scientific research on tertiary education dropout (Ashour,   2020a ,  2020b ; Alkaabi and Noor   2020 ). Unfortunately, most local studies and reports did not differentiate between dropout rates in high schools and universities, potentially obscur -  ing the true extent of the issue (Chaudhary   2013 ; Bridi and Al Hosani   2022 ). Regardless of the specific dropout rate, the federal government implemented several policies and initiatives aiming to ensure an adequate supply of educated local workforce and a rea -  sonable reduction in dropout, especially among males, who comprise less than 30% of all university students (Hamdan,   2013 ; Yaghi,   2024 ). However, despite these efforts, government intervention has not yet effectively eliminated or significantly reduced the dropout numbers. The Ministry of Education asserts that the 14% dropout rate, com -  pared to other countries, may not be excessively high but still signifies a grave problem (Nasir   2017 ).  Using the basic definition of dropout as the non-completion of education (Krsti � c, Stepanovi � c-Ili � c, and Videnovi � c   2017 ), previous research findings suggest that dropout, in general, is linked to various factors, including students’ lack of interest in academic life, poor academic performance, low grades, excessive absences and tardiness, on- campus   misconduct,   repeated   changes   of   schools,   and   changes   in   college   majors (Ashour   2020a ,   2020b ; Parahoo, Harvey, and Tamim   2013 ; Hassock and Hill   2022a ). The persistent occurrence of this phenomenon, especially among males, necessitates a closer examination of these factors within the UAE context. The UAE’s case is signifi -  cant   for   many   reasons;   it   is   one   of   the   few   countries   grappling   with   a   deeply entrenched demographic imbalance. Even before independence and the unification of the seven emirates, expatriates constituted a considerable portion of the UAE popula -  tion (Ashour   2020a ,   2020b ; Wilkins, Balakrishnan, and Huisman   2012 ). As the UAE embraces a free market, the government faces the challenge of balancing its flourish -  ing economy, heavily reliant on foreign human labor, with its obligation to cultivate a national capacity based on locally trained and well-qualified individuals, particularly university graduates. Government intervention appears to be a top national priority,  JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION   3

as evidenced by the 70-year plan, a long-term national development strategy, which lists the training and qualification of local human capital as a top priority (Ashour  2020a ,   2020b ; Yaghi and Bates   2023 ).  Theory  This section delves into prominent theories and pertinent literature on student dropout, particularly in PAPS programs. It explores two categories of theories offering plausible explanations for dropout: (a) the integration and engagement theory by Spady ( 1970 ,  1971 ) and Tinto ( 1975 ,   2012 ) and (b) the pull-push and failing-out theory by Jordan, Lara, and McPartland ( 1994 ) and Watt and Roessingh ( 1994 ). It also summarizes some of the most common factors that influence dropout, such as socioeconomic, personal, scholastic, and policy factors.  First, the integration and engagement theory includes the work of Vincent Tinto ( 2012 ) who explained that students leave college for three main reasons: they struggle academically, they are uncertain about their educational and career goals, and they do not feel connected to the academic and social community of the institution. Tinto’s "Model of Institutional Departure" explains these factors by arguing that, to stay in col -  lege, students need to be involved in both formal (academic achievement) and informal (interaction with faculty and staff) academic systems and both formal (participation in extracurricular activities) and informal (relationship with peers) social systems (Tinto  1975 ,   2012 ; Aljohani   2016 ). Based on Durkheim’s Suicide Theory (Durkheim   1951 ), Spady ( 1970 ,   1971 ) argued that the interaction between students and their surrounding is the outcome of exposing individual students’ attributes such as preferences, interests, attitudes and skills to the influences, expectations and demands of the different compo -  nents of their institutions including courses, faculty members, administrators and peers. He further posited that the outcome of this interaction determines the level of students’ integration within the academic and social systems of their institutions and conse -  quently their persistence (Spady   1971 ). Therefore, a student’s decision to stay or with -  draw from his or her academic institution is influenced by two main factors in each of two systems: grades and intellectual development in the academic system, and norma -  tive   correspondence   and   friendship   support   in   the   social   system   (Aljohani   2016 ; Nicoletti   2019 ).  Second, the pull-push and failing-out theory includes the work of Doll, Eslami, and Walters ( 2013 ) who explain that three groups of factors influence the behavior of dropping out of school, namely push factors, pull factors, and falling out factors. Push factors refer to school-related factors that make a student’s life at school a negative experience, such as having bad relationships with teachers, improper school building and equipment, testing policy, and attendance policy. According to Jordan, Lara, and McPartland ( 1994 ), the pull factors refer to outside-school factors attract -  ing or forcing students to drop out, such as family-related factors, job recruiters from agencies, economic needs, social struggle, and disability. Failingout of school refers to factors that relate to the students themselves, such as lack of interest in learning,   bad   attitude,   aggressive   behavior   against   others,   and   poor   academic achievement (Watt and Roessingh   1994 ; Doll, Eslami, and Walters   2013 ). It can be  4   A. YAGHI

Page 6:
said that push, pull, and failing out factors are interrelated yet have different effects on dropout. As Doll, Eslami, and Walters ( 2013 , p.2) clarify, the agency factor dis -  tinguishes between each group of factors; the agent in push out factors is school while it is society in pull out factors and the individual students in the failing out factors. The agency, therefore, plays an important role in public policy because the intervention to reduce dropout should target the right component where the push out, the pull out, and the failing out factors occur.  Regardless however of the agent where the causes of dropout may happen, the core of dropout remains student’s disengagement with the school. Because push, pull and failing out factors may overlap, they cause confusion to policymakers about where the intervention should start (Finn   1993 ; Yaghi, Morris, and Gibson   2007 ). Lehr et al. ( 2004 ) explain that disengagement is the fundamental behavior in dropout because stu -  dents   make   decision   to   leave   school   because   they   failed   to   belong   to   the   school. Whatever happens after or before disengagement itself is something that may go beyond the direct control of policymakers. Disengagement is associated with certain problems which the government can influence with the proper policies. These problems according to Lehr et al. ( 2004 ) and Finn ( 1993 ) include student’s constant withdrawals, unusual school experiences in the past or present, poor sense of belonging, and disliking school. These factors and others make student’s disengagement a reality that is difficult to reverse (Finn   1993 ). Students’ engagement in school, thus, is an integral part of stu -  dents’ completion of school; when students engage in school on psychological, social, and academic levels, they are likely to finish their study and graduate.  In the following section, a summary of the most relevant literature on dropout will show how socioeconomic, personal, scholastic, and policy factors influence dropout which all can be explained by a theoretical combination of push, pull, and failing out and disengagement theories. From this discussion, it is proposed that student dropout will be influenced by many factors, including demographics, family, society, institu -  tional, and academic performance factors (proposition 1).  Relevant literature  This section reviews relevant literature on student dropout, with a focus on dropout in PAPS programs whenever possible. It explores the multifaceted factors associated with dropout,   including   social   maladjustment,   behavioral   disorders,   delinquency,   socio- economic variables, academic advising, registration difficulties, work responsibilities, health status, anxiety, uncertainty, isolation, alienation, academic challenges, teaching methodolo -  gies, teacher attitudes, attendance, motivation, interest, goal setting, expectations, engage -  ment, social support, and economic challenges. Additionally, it compares and contrasts findings from different countries and contexts, identifying commonalities among them.  Notably, there was a scarcity of prior research specifically addressing the dropout or intention to dropout of PAPS students in the UAE; most studies were generalized to student dropout in higher education. Even in other countries, prior research predomin -  antly focused on STEM fields rather than PAPS (Pasha-Zaidi and Afari   2016 ). However, a review of existing studies reveals three key facts: (a) dropout is influenced by a multi -  tude of factors; (b) the UAE shares several factors influencing dropout with other  JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION   5

Page 7:
countries; and (c) empirical studies substantiate the assertions of the major theories dis -  cussed earlier. The ensuing discussion highlights select studies closely aligned with the scope of this research.  Fortin et al. ( 2006 ) and Nurmalitasari, Long, and Noor ( 2023 ) delineated that drop -  out was associated with students’ social maladjustment, behavioral disorders, and delin -  quency. They categorized dropout students into four groups based on the reasons for their dropout, including disinterest in education, difficulties in adjusting to school and social life, covert disengagement due to family or social reasons, and students experienc -  ing depression, anxiety, or other health issues hindering their studies (Fortin et al.   2006 ; Yaghi   2022 ).  Several studies emphasized the link between dropout and students’ socio-economic variables. Hailat et al. ( 2022 ) contended that economically disadvantaged students and those from low-income families were at a higher risk of university dropout. Salim ( 2019 ) identified diverse factors contributing to dropout, encompassing student attitudes toward school, academic performance, absenteeism, institutional shortcomings, family- related issues, and financial constraints. Additionally, Chaudhary ( 2013 ) emphasized the impact of family size, parental involvement, and negative school experiences on stu -  dents’ decisions to drop out.  In neighboring Oman, Sangeetha ( 2021 ) found that low-income, poor academic per -  formance, and personal factors such as lack of interest and health problems influenced STEM student dropout. In Saudi Arabia, absenteeism, lack of educational goals, the need for employment, and a perceived diminished value of academic degrees were iden -  tified as predictors of dropout (Al Abdulrazaq, Abdulmutalib, and Abdullah   2022 ). Morocco experienced dropout rates between 28% and 30% among first and second-year university students, with factors like health status, anxiety, academic challenges, inad -  equate teaching methodologies, and alienation contributing significantly (Razouki et al.  2019 ).  The literature highlights striking similarities in dropout factors across diverse coun -  tries, suggesting that dropout is increasingly a global concern (Fortin et al.   2006 ; Smith and Yang   2017 ). Factors such as academic advising, registration issues, engagement, social support, learning difficulties, lack of motivation, and economic challenges were found to be common predictors in various international contexts (Smith and Yang  2017 ). These findings indicate that while the factors influencing student dropout are similar across countries, their impact might differ based on cultural and institutional contexts (proposition 2).  Despite the breadth of research, the literature reveals an intricate web of factors influ -  encing dropout. However, a clear delineation of universal versus context-specific factors is lacking. Consequently, this study argues that dropout among PAPS students results from a complex interplay of personal, social, institutional, and economic factors that influence a student’s decision to leave university without completing their degree (prop -  osition 3). Given this ambiguity and the absence of a comprehensive dropout theory, this study proposes employing exploratory factor analysis to identify crucial predictors of dropout specific to PAPS in the UAE. This approach aims to provide nuanced insights for policymakers, educators, and academic administrators grappling with the challenge of student dropout in PAPS programs.  6   A. YAGHI

Methods  This study focused on the dropout phenomenon among undergraduate PAPS students in the UAE. The population of the study consisted of students enrolled in undergradu -  ate PAPS programs across 5 universities in 2023 (see,   Table 1 ). These universities col -  lectively enrolled over 55,000 students at various levels, including bachelor, master, and doctorate programs. While the exact figures for undergraduate PAPS enrollment in 2023–2024 were not officially available, it was estimated to range between 30 and 1000 students. Despite the popularity of PAPS programs, the issue of dropout raised signifi -  cant concerns among stakeholders, including decision-makers, parents, and educators. Limited research on this subject exacerbated these concerns, adding ambiguity to the underlying factors behind student dropout.  To investigate this phenomenon, the study interviewed 18 participants who fell into various categories denoting dropout among master’s students: (a) those who dropped out between 2013 and 2023; (b) students who studied at least one master-level course but did not complete it and left the program; (c) students who completed one course but did not continue; (d) students who studied several courses but did not fulfill all the requirements; and (e) students who completed coursework but did not defend their master’s thesis, thus not graduating. These dropouts participated in semi-structured interviews where they provided in-depth insights about their experiences (Guest, Bunce, and Johnson   2006 ).  In this study, we embraced a mixed-methods approach, acknowledging the comple -  mentary strengths of both quantitative and qualitative research. The rationale behind employing both methods is rooted in our dedication to an exhaustive exploration of the student dropout phenomenon. Quantitative data, amassed through surveys from under -  graduate students, lays a broad statistical groundwork to discern patterns and trends in dropout intentions. Conversely, qualitative data, procured from interviews with graduate  Table 1.   Sample PAPS programs in the UAE in 2023–2024.  Name of the university �   Public affairs program offered  1.

participants, yields intricate insights into the lived experiences and retrospective con -  templations on the dropout process.  The deliberate engagement of two distinct populations for data collection was strategic. Undergraduates, positioned at the vanguard of the educational experience, provide immediate and contemporary perspectives on elements that may sway their decision to persist or cease their studies. Graduates, conversely, offer a longitudinal perspective, reflecting on their entire educational odyssey and the repercussions of their choices.  This methodological choice facilitates a diachronic analysis, encapsulating both the anticipatory and the realized facets of the dropout experience. We do not seek direct comparability between the two datasets; rather, we value the profound, stratified com -  prehension that arises from their interplay. The quantitative scrutiny of undergraduates’ intentions acts as a prognostic gauge, while the qualitative revelations from graduates furnish a confirmatory perspective on the actual dropout occurrences.  We recognize that this approach might prompt inquiries regarding the amalgamation of findings from the two cohorts. Nonetheless, we contend that the potency of our study is anchored in its capacity to weave a multi-faceted narrative of the dropout phe -  nomenon. The quantitative and qualitative findings are not conjoined haphazardly; they are   construed   as   interconnected,   yet   discrete,   contributions   to   an   all-encompassing understanding of the dynamics influencing dropout rates within PAPS programs.  A specialized survey, developed based on the literature review, was administered to a random convenience sample of 384 undergraduate PAPS students between September 2022 and July 2023. The research team employed a drop-off, pick-up method for collecting completed surveys. Both the survey and interview methods were deemed appropriate for achieving the study’s objectives (Jackson-Smith et al.   2016 ; Allred and Ross-Davis   2011 ). Identifying undergraduate students who dropped out posed a signifi -  cant challenge as universities either lacked updated addresses for these students or did not release relevant information. Consequently, the survey included questions about stu -  dents’ "intention" to dropout, encompassing those with low GPAs, multiple dropped courses, major changes, suspensions, or behavioral issues. Previous research supported assessing the "intention" to dropout as a valid measure of students’ dropout behavior (Astin   1975 ; Pascarella and Terenzini   1980 ; Fourie   2020 ; Morelli et al.   2023 ; Mostert, van Rensburg, and Machaba   2023 ).  To ensure the validity of the survey study design, the researchers followed a rigorous procedure. Initially, the survey was administered to a convenience sample of 1275 PAPS students. Subsequently, surveys in which respondents answered "No" to any of the fol -  lowing   three   introductory   questions   were excluded:   "Have   you   ever thought   about changing your current major?" "Have you ever thought about dropping out of univer -  sity?" "Have you ever made a plan to drop out of school?" The remaining 384 surveys underwent   analysis   using   PSS.V29.   The   survey   was   meticulously   evaluated   by   five experts, including three professors and two language specialists. These experts provided valuable feedback regarding the number and wording of survey questions. The revised version of the survey underwent a second evaluation and approval by the experts before being piloted with 78 students. The final survey exhibited acceptable reliability, indi -  cated by a Cronbach’s Alpha measure of   a   ¼   0.889 (McNeish   2018 ).  8   A. YAGHI

their major. These findings hold significant implications for educators, parents, and aca -  demic administrators, as these numbers, while in line with the global trend of student dropout across other majors, are relatively high (Gallagher   2019 ). Subsequent sections will delve deeper into these matters.  To provide a comprehensive view of dropout,   Table 5   presents the descriptive statis -  tics of the survey items. According to   Table 5 , the mean scores of the survey items were above 2.5 out of 5.0, except for seven items, indicating that students generally agreed with the survey questions. This supports the argument that the intention to dropout is complex, with students facing multiple obstacles affecting their retention (Fourie   2020 ; Hailat et al.   2022 ). However, mean values alone may not suffice to fully elucidate drop -  out and test the study’s propositions. Hence, after confirming the dataset’s suitability for   advanced   analysis,   an   Exploratory   Factor   Analysis   (EFA)   was   conducted   (see  Table 6 ). The results from KMO and Bartlett’s test (0.87 and p   <   0.001, respectively) in  Table 6   indicate that the data are suitable for EFA (Field   2018 ). Following varimax rota -  tion, the six extracted factors account for a cumulative percentage of variance of 78.5%, as indicated by the rotation sums of squared loadings. Nevertheless, as previously high -  lighted, employing Factor Analysis to identify the determinants of student dropout is fraught with complexities. This arises from the methodology’s emphasis on assessing undergraduates’ intentions to discontinue their studies, as opposed to the actual inci -  dence of dropout. These intentions are fluid, shaped by personal perceptions, and may not precisely reflect the decisive elements and contexts precipitating the final decision to drop out. Although exploratory factor analysis can uncover factors that potentially influence these intentions, its ability to fully capture the myriad of factors that culmin -  ate in dropout is constrained. Nonetheless, it is crucial to recognize that within the social sciences, the concept of “intention” is deemed a valid forecaster of behavior, thereby validating the ensuing analysis (see, Sheeran   2002 ; Webb and Sheeran   2006 ).  The labels of the emerged factors in   Table 6   align with the content of the survey items that loaded on each factor, namely (1) family and society, (2) economic, (3) program and curriculum, (4) institutional, (5) academic performance of the student, and (6) personal attitude. These factors reveal the intricate nature of dropout, supporting the study’s prop -  osition 1. This discovery also lends empirical credence to previous research highlighting the multifaceted nature of dropout (Hailat et al.   2022 ; Chaudhary   2013 ). For instance, Nicoletti ( 2019 ) emphasized the significance of academic performance and social factors in students’ dropout decisions. Mouton, Zhang, and Ertl ( 2020 ) reported a substantial relationship between dropout and institutional, social, and personal factors. Although these assertions were made about university students without a specific focus on any major group, they bear relevance because PAPS students are integral to the student body. Consequently, dropout appears to be a complex phenomenon even among PAPS students (see Schultz   2019 ; Holzer and Lin   2007 ; Holzer, Xu, and Wang   2007 ).  To delve deeper into Proposition 1, all survey items that loaded on one factor were amalgamated to form a new construct (variable). These constructed variables were then regressed against the dependent variable, which is a construct of three survey items measuring students’ intention to quit (refer to   Table 3 ). While multiple regression mod -  els were developed,   Table 7   showcases the most suitable model, indicating that 14 inde -  pendent variables predict PAPS students’ dropout (R2   ¼   0.62).

�   Financial Support: Establishing multiple funding avenues, such as scholarships and assistantships, to alleviate financial burdens.  �   Curricular Adjustments: Incorporating more practical components into the cur -  riculum, reducing the emphasis on theoretical material, and offering alternative tracks for students who prefer not to write a thesis.  �   Support   Services:   Providing   robust   academic   and   personal   support   services, including counseling and mentorship programs, to help students navigate their challenges.  To address concerns about the potential depletion of a crucial source of human power in the UAE’s public sector, decision-makers need to act upon the findings of this study and the mapping of factors more significant to PAPS programs. One key revela -  tion is the significant impact of institutional rigidity and inadequate funding on the attractiveness of PAPS programs, especially for graduate students. While the balancing act between work, family, and academics is undeniably a personal challenge, univer -  sities, specifically departments and program administrations, wield considerable influ -  ence in either easing or intensifying this struggle. A more flexible approach in designing lectures, class timings, and the theoretical components of courses could provide students with greater opportunities to maintain a harmonious life balance. Additionally, univer -  sities should proactively establish multiple funding avenues, such as scholarships and assistantships, to alleviate the financial burden on students. Unlike doctoral students who actively engage in research projects, many PAPS working students are full-time employees, leaving them with limited time for academic pursuits.  Curricular issues, such as the language of study and the structure of study plans, are areas where academic managers can directly intervene to enhance the student experi -  ence. The requirement of writing and defending a master’s thesis emerged as a daunting theme leading to dropout, particularly as many students perceive their master’s degree as   a   means   to   acquire   practical   skills   rather   than   engaging   in   extensive   academic research (Yaghi   2008 ; Yaghi and Alabed   2021 ). Incorporating a more practical compo -  nent, reducing the emphasis on theoretical material, and offering alternative tracks for students who prefer not to write a thesis could significantly improve program attractive -  ness. For undergraduate curricula, it is imperative that departments of PAP rejuvenate their course offerings by incorporating modern content and engaging pedagogies. These courses should not only preserve the pertinence of political science and public affairs doctrines   in   relation   to   contemporary   issues   but   also   promote   a   vigorous   synergy between theoretical constructs and practical application. The principle of melding aca -  demic theory with real-world practice is well-established; however, this study under -  scores the necessity of allocating time and resources to the continual refinement of educational   programs.   It   is   paramount   to   heed   student   feedback,   such   as   end-of- semester evaluations of courses and instructors, employing this feedback constructively to advance both the curriculum content and pedagogical approaches.  While this study focused specifically on PAPS students in the UAE, the findings have broader   implications   that   warrant   further   investigation.   The   dropout   phenomenon, influenced by factors such as family, economic, personal, academic, and institutional forces, is not necessarily unique to the UAE. Similar patterns have been observed in  JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE EDUCATION   19

other contexts, suggesting that the results of this study may be applicable to programs in other countries as well (see, Aina et al.   2022 ; Pusztai, F � enyes, and Kov � acs   2022 ). However, it is crucial to conduct comparative studies across various majors and differ -  ent   country   contexts   to   validate   these   findings   and   ensure   accurate   generalization. Researchers are encouraged to conduct comparative studies across various majors, par -  ticularly in high-demand fields such as PAPS, management, and STEM, where dropout rates persist. Decision-makers are urged to revitalize PAPS programs, enhance curricula, and bolster student support, with particular emphasis on financial empowerment. The language of instruction, thesis requirements, and course content need reconsideration, with a focus on adapting these aspects to the practical needs and time constraints of working students.  Future research endeavors should delve deeper into the quality and relevance of mas -  ter’s theses, assessing their contributions to the field. Additionally, exploring how stu -  dents perceive the utility of their academic degrees could provide valuable insights. Larger and more diverse samples, as well as comparative studies across universities and programs, are essential for a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing student dropout and can offer specific insights into each university’s unique academic programs and their impact on dropout rates.

Findings and discussion  Table 2   illustrates that 79% of undergraduate students fall within the ages of 19 to 26 years, with nearly half of them (47%) falling between 19 and 22 years old. Similar to most other majors, the majority of PAPS students (62%) are female. Given the relatively late age of marriage in the UAE for both genders, 92% of the students are single, and 78% come from middle-class income families. Moreover, 93% of the students come from two-parent households, and 88% have at least one parent employed in a paid posi -  tion. This data reflects the societal shift in the UAE toward increased education and modernization, leading to smaller family sizes (refer to   Tables 2   and   3 ).  Tables 2   and   3   also indicate that 55% of the students have 3–5 siblings, with only 14% having more than five siblings. Most students have educated parents; 68% of moth -  ers and 70% of fathers possess bachelor’s degrees. Consequently, 67% of the students discuss their academic life with their parents. Intriguingly, 20% of the students never discuss their academic life with their parents, which could be a cause for concern unless this group of students comes from families with divorced or deceased parent(s).  Table 3   suggests that students predominantly choose their major without parental interference; 34% were somewhat uninvolved, and 38% had no parental interference at all.   However,   it’s   essential   to   note   the   possibility   of   self-reporting   bias   in   these responses. A significant portion (38%) of students reported health problems, while around 16% indicated having some form of disability and 29% reported experiencing psychological   problems,   such   as   stress,   anxiety,   and   depression.

psychological distress might be influenced by post-COVID-19 pandemic conditions, as previous studies have reported a considerable number of university students facing post-pandemic psychological challenges (see, for example, Yaghi   2022 ).  Although the study did not initially articulate a hypothesis regarding gender, the phe -  nomenon of male dropout emerges as a central focus of this investigation.   Table 4  delineates   the   outcomes   of   three   pivotal   questions   concerning   dropout   intentions. Notable   disparities   were   observed   between   male   and   female   students   across   these queries, with the propensity to withdraw from studies being most pronounced ( v 2 ¼  Male:   9.086,   Female:   4.877),   thereby   substantiating   the   discourse   on   gender-related dropout dynamics. Specifically, the proportion of male students considering withdrawal consistently exceeded that of their female counterparts, with figures ranging from 60 to 65 percent. Conversely, only 23.4% of male students reported never contemplating dropout, in stark contrast to 60.8% of female students. These findings furnish empirical substantiation of a skewed distribution of dropout rates between genders; despite a lower overall male student population, their dropout rate is disproportionately higher.  Table 4   indicates that 27.15% of male and 9.6% of female PAPS students have, at some point, opted to change their major or university. The disparity between male and female students is notable, with 58.2% of male students and 81.9% of female students having never made such a change. Regarding contemplation of changing their current major, only 30.1% of male and 49.1% of female students reported never considering this option. Similarly, just 18.4% of male and 36.9% of female PAPS students have never contemplated discontinuing their university studies prior to obtaining a degree. These  Table 3.

statistics highlight that a significant portion of both genders harbor doubts about their studies, signaling to policymakers and academic administrators that a substantial num -  ber of students question the utility, appeal, rigor, or perhaps the robustness of their PAP curriculum. In essence, while male students demonstrate a greater tendency to withdraw or change their major/university, female students exhibit a comparably con -  cerning trend, albeit with less intensity.  These finding may align with prior research from Western countries where, for instance, 38% of students in all majors in American universities change their major at least once during their academic journey (Astorne-Figari and Speer   2019 ; The Ohio State University   2023 ; The University of Tulsa   2020 ). However, in the absence of com -  parable data regarding PAPS students, a precise comparison remains elusive.While lim -  ited studies have been conducted on PAPS students, the available information suggests that dropout rates among PAPS students may follow a similar trend to that of other majors (Brower and Klay   2000 ). However, within the UAE context, decision-makers in PAPS programs should be particularly concerned about the fact that 38% of PAPS stu -  dents have considered dropping out of university, and 30% have contemplated changing  Table 4.

emerged as the most robust predictor (B   ¼   .436, b   ¼   .412), followed closely by economic variables (B   ¼   .412, b   ¼   .403), program and curriculum factors (B   ¼   .411, b   ¼   .395), and personal attitude of the student (B   ¼   .357, b   ¼   .309). Students’ psychological well-being was correlated with dropout (B   ¼   .312, b   ¼   .251) alongside two family factors: family income (B   ¼   − .344, b   ¼   .310) and family and social influence (B   ¼   .347, b   ¼   .312). Additionally,   Table 7   underscores the significance of institutional factors (B   ¼   .303, b   ¼  .299), as well as the variable indicating whether students ever changed their major (B   ¼  .362, b   ¼   .315). Gender emerged as a significant predictor of dropout (B   ¼   .284, b   ¼  .211), suggesting the need for further studies to explore and compare dropout patterns among male and female students in PAPS majors. The role of family and parents in dropout is evident, as parents’ involvement was positively correlated with dropout (B   ¼  .212, b   ¼   .214). Moreover, aspects of the home environment, such as a deceased parent (B   ¼   .211, b   ¼   .183) and parents’ divorce (B   ¼   .207, b   ¼   .202), influenced dropout deci -  sions. How a major was chosen also played a role (B   ¼   − .264, b   ¼   − .222).  Table 6.   Factor loading.

The findings presented in   Table 7   substantiate proposition 1 of the study. Moreover, these results support Doll, Eslami, and Walters ( 2013 ) argument, as curriculum and institutional variables in   Table 7   can act as push factors, making students’ university experience less pleasant. Health issues, disability, and family dynamics serve as pull fac -  tors, enticing students toward dropout. Meanwhile, students’ personal attitudes, includ -  ing tardiness, absence, and disengagement from university life (see Finn   1993 ; Lehr et al.   2004 ), serve as failing factors that bring students closer to dropping out.  In alignment with previous research by Fortin et al. ( 2006 ), Salim ( 2019 ), and Hailat et al. ( 2022 ), the current study underscores the pivotal role of economic factors as pre -  dictors of dropout. Economic factors encompass both family income and a student’s inability to afford tuition and other study-related costs (refer to   Tables 2   and   3 ). Consequently, policymakers must intensify efforts and devise efficient strategies to pro -  vide alternatives for students from economically disadvantaged backgrounds or those unable to pay their tuition due to various reasons.  However, it is important to note a deviation in the study’s findings concerning stu -  dents’ dropout in the UAE compared to previous research. While Salim ( 2019 ) and Chaudhary ( 2013 ) emphasized the significance of family and social aspects, particularly family size and parents’ employment status, the current study does not support these assertions, as   Table 6   indicates no significant relationship between these variables and dropout. This disparity in findings could be attributed to two themes: the time lapse and the   reference   students.   The   aforementioned   studies   were   conducted   in   schools,   not  Table 7.
