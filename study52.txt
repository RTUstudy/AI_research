Fostering   E quity in Rural Education: a Literature   R eview on Student Dropout and Retention Strategies  ___________________________________________________________________________  Rev. Gest. Soc.

Although strategies for unive rsities are proposed, the results suggest  that there is still a lack of effective and questionable policies that holistically address the  dropout situation in this context.  The objective of the study conducted by   Guzmán et al. (2022) was to explore the re asons  behind student dropout in rural higher education, using a systemic approach and analyzing the  narrative experiences of Colombian students. The results revealed that the main recurring  variables among the participants were work and family responsibili ties, the economic situation  of the learner and the role of the educators in the educational process. Based on these variables  and the model used, they presented recommendations to be integrated into the framework of  governmental and institutional measures   to prevent and mitigate the dropout phenomenon.  These projected actions seek to contribute to greater student retention and to promote equitable  access to university - level education in rural environments, thus generating a positive effect on  the education al and social progress of students in these regions.  In their study,   Véliz & Zambrano (2018)   highlight the importance of understanding the  educational situation in rural areas, where the desire of young people to access university is  closely linked to th eir economic condition and the context of marginalization. Factors such as  the lack of teachers specialized in rural education and the absence of effective policies can affect  the quality of education in these areas. Despite this, there is evidence of an i mprovement in the  outlook for higher education, with 80% of rural inhabitants confident that their children will  have a promising future after completing their university studies. This change in mentality  reflects greater confidence in the education system   and its ability to provide rural youth with  the skills required for successful personal and professional development.  The examples given represent different approaches and contexts in which the causes of  student dropout from rural universities have been   investigated, providing valuable information  for understanding and approaching this phenomenon from different perspectives.  3   METHODOLOGY  In this research, a documentary review was carried out. For the construction of  knowledge, content analysis was used as the main strategy.   (Lissabet, 2017) . This technique  was selected due to its ability to develop studies in an unbiased and quality mann er, minimizing  existing biases and providing reliable results for the scientific community.  In carrying out this study, we adopted the approach proposed by   Rosales - Veitía &  Marcano - Montilla (2022)   as a methodological guide. These authors emphasize the im portance  of establishing a precise definition and a clear methodological route in this type of research, in  order to ensure transparency and validation of the results by readers, reviewers and other  researchers. It also recognizes the need to implement a s et of strategies that allow for the  adequate retrieval, selection and analysis of relevant documents. Following these guidelines, it  was possible to develop a rigorous study that promotes the construction and reconstruction of  knowledge on the subject of s tudent dropout in rural universities.  In order to retrieve relevant information, the recognized databases Scopus, Redalyc,  Scielo, Dialnet and Google Scholar were used as data sources. These platforms are recognized  in the scientific community and provide   access to peer - reviewed documents, thus guaranteeing  their excellence. To carry out this process, an initial search was undertaken that yielded a total  of 132 scientific articles. These articles were then systematized and selected by means of a  sampling ba sed on established criteria. The studies that met the characteristics presented in  Table 1 were considered for inclusion in the analysis, resulting in a total of 57 papers selected  for the development of this review.

In addition, lack of clarity in academic and career goals, as well as lack of a sense of  belonging to the educational institution can also undermine s tudent motivation and increase the  likelihood of dropout (Kuruppuarachchi & Karunanayake, 2017). When students do not have a  clear vision of their educational and career goals, it can be difficult to maintain long - term  motivation. Uncertainty about the pat h ahead and job prospects can generate doubts and  demotivation, increasing the risk of attrition   (Rodríguez - Pineda & Zamora - Araya, 2021). .  Likewise, identification with the academic community is another factor to consider in  the motivation and retention   of students (Patri et al., 2023). When students at rural universities  do not feel part of the university community, they may experience a lack of emotional and social  connection with their educational environment. The absence of a supportive environment an d  the lack of positive relationships with peers and faculty can undermine student motivation and  sense of belonging   (Marôco et al., 2020). .  Academic and career expectations are also a relevant factor in the dropout of higher  level learners in rural setti ngs   (Perera & Abeysekera, 2020) . Some students may experience  doubts about their ability to succeed academically or to find suitable job opportunities once they  complete their university studies. These uncertainties may undermine their commitment and  lead   to early dropout decisions   (Navarro - Roldan & Zamudio, 2021).   On the other hand, when  students   have   clear   and   realistic   expectations   about   the   educational   and   professional  opportunities that await them, they tend to be more motivated and committed to thei r studies .  To summarize, this category has revealed that aspects such as socioeconomic status,  family support, motivation, and academic and professional expectations have a significant  influence on the dropout of students from rural u niversities. Learners from disadvantaged  socioeconomic backgrounds face financial difficulties in meeting educational expenses, which  increases the likelihood of dropping out. Emotional support and family recognition of education  promote student retention,   while lack of family support can lead to demotivation and  disengagement. Lack of internal motivation and lack of clarity in academic and professional  goals also increase the risk of dropout. These findings underscore the importance of addressing  these fac tors in the design of educational strategies and policies that foster the retention and  educational success of rural learners, promoting educational equity  4.2   Geographical and access barriers  Geographic and access barriers also represent significant challenges for rural university  students. These barriers can hinder their ability to access and continue in university education  (Félix et al., 2023).   Some of the key issues that have been recognize d in this category include  distance to educational institutions, lack of adequate transportation, insufficient infrastructure,  and technological limitations.  With regard to distance to universities, it is undeniable that it represents a major barrier  faced   by students. The remote location of these institutions can make access difficult for  students living in remote areas. The lack of nearby universities may require rural students to  travel long distances to attend classes, which implies higher transportatio n costs and more time  invested in commuting   (Bruno et al., 2022) .  This situation can have several negative effects on the educational journey of learners.  First, increased transportation costs can place a significant financial burden on students and  their   families. Transportation expenses, whether in the form of fuel, public transportation fares,  or vehicle maintenance, can represent an additional financial hurdle for those students already

Soc.

In addition to all these factors, technological limitations are also a major challenge for  students in rural universities   (Furlong et al., 2021) , because the limited avail ability of high -  speed connections and the lack of appropriate equipment can limit the availability of digital  tools, online learning platforms and virtual communication opportunities, generating a digital  divide between rural and urban students, making it   difficult to access updated information and  technological tools necessary for their academic development   (Van & Thi, 2021).  In short, geographic and access barriers represent major obstacles for rural university  students. Distance to educational institutio ns, lack of adequate transportation, insufficient  educational infrastructure and technological limitations make it difficult for rural learners to  access and actively engage in university education, increasing the likelihood of dropout and  limiting their l earning opportunities.  4.3   Quality of education and available resources  Another element that influences the dropout of rural university students is the quality of  education and available resources. This category has made it possibl e to identify some key  elements such as the evaluation of education in terms of available educational resources, teacher  training, learning opportunities, and restrictions in the availability of academic programs.  In the context of rural universities, the accessibility and excellence of educational  materials are essential elements that influence student retention and the quality of education  (González et al., 2019) . Educational resources cover a wide range of elemen ts, from traditional  teaching materials to advanced technology and access to online resources   (Carrasco, 2021) .  Lack of access to up - to - date, quality educational resources can have a significant effect on  learning opportunities for disciples. In many insta nces, rural universities may face difficulties  in keeping their libraries up to date, which limits access to books, academic journals, and other  relevant study materials. Also, the lack of well - equipped laboratories and modern technology  can affect student s' experience in fields that require experimental practices and technical skills  (Perez et al., 2019) .  As discussed, the limited availability of educational resources in rural universities can  generate inequalities between students in these areas and tho se who have access to a greater  variety of resources in urban educational institutions   (Navarro et al., 2017) . This disparity can  negatively affect the quality of education and create barriers to academic progress for rural  students. Limitations in the availability of quality educational materials can affect knowledge  acquisition, research, skill development, and   the ability of learners to meet academic challenges  (González & Arismendi, 2018).  On the other hand, the level of teacher training plays a crucial role in the quality of  education and, therefore, in the prevention of student dropout. Well - trained teachers   are capable  of providing excellent instruction, adjusted to the individual demands of rural students and  based on updated pedagogical approaches   (Peña & Patiño, 2022). . However, in many cases,  rural university teachers face challenges in terms of profes sional development and training  opportunities. Lack of resources and specific programs can limit their access to ongoing  training, resulting in a gap in their pedagogical skills and knowledge, affecting the quality of  education provided to rural learners.   Teachers who are not adequately trained may have  difficulty adapting their instructional methods according to the particularities and profiles of  rural learners. This can lead to a lack of active participation, lack of interest and, ultimately, to  student   dropout   (Otero, 2021) .

Soc. Ambient. |   Miami   |   v.1 8 .n. 1   |   p. 1 - 18   |   e0 4922   |   202 4 .  10  In addition, lack of training in key areas, such as the use of educational technologies and  the implementation of inclusive approaches, can limit learning and development opportunities  for rural students. The lack of resources and   updated pedagogical knowledge can generate a  mismatch between the educational needs of students and what is offered to them, which can  demotivate them and drive them away from their studies   (Erazo & Rosero, 2022).  It is true that lim ited academic offerings in rural universities can have a significant  impact on student retention and dropout. The lack of specialized programs and diversified study  options can limit the learning opportunities and integral development of learners, which in   turn  can affect their motivation and commitment to their studies   (Pérez et al., 2023). . On many  occasions, rural students may face the difficult decision of choosing between academic  programs that do not fully match their interests and career goals, or   moving to urban institutions  to access a greater variety of academic options   (Alvarez, 2021) . This situation can generate a  sense of dissatisfaction and demotivation among rural students, who may perceive a lack of  opportunities to develop their skills a nd talents in their own community.  At the same time, the limitation in academic offerings may also affect the holistic  formation of learners, since participation in extracurricular activities and specialized programs  is fundamental for their personal and p rofessional growth   (Carvajal & Cervantes, 2017). . The  lack of extracurricular options can reduce the possibilities for developing social skills,  leadership and teamwork, essential aspects for success in student life and beyond   (Duche et al.,  2020) . The refore, it is essential that rural universities work on expanding their academic  offerings and creating specialized programs that fit the needs and interests of learners, in order  to ensure student retention (Duche et al., 2020).  It is relevant to highlig ht that educational excellence and available resources refer not  only to tangible aspects, but also to the quality of the educational environment and the  institutional climate. A supportive, inclusive and participatory environment can influence  student ret ention and academic success   (Domínguez - Lara et al., 2021) . On the other hand, the  lack of an environment conducive to learning can generate demotivation and disengagement on  the part of students, thus increasing the probability of dropping out   (Rueda et al ., 2020).  4.4   Cultural and social aspects  Cultural and social aspects play a crucial role in the determination of rural university  students to continue or drop out of higher education. These elements are deepl y rooted in the  rural context and can have a significant impact on students' perceptions and decisions regarding  their education   (Zambrano et al., 2018).  In rural settings, community norms and social expectations exert a significant influence  on learners ' perceptions of the relevance of higher education   (Hernández & Padilla, 2021) . In  many of these communities, the traditional valuing of agricultural work and traditional trades  has been a fundamental part of their cultural and economic identity for gene rations. As a result,  university education can be perceived as a less relevant option or even as a deviation from  established roles and traditions   (Reategui et al., 2020).  Young students may feel strong pressure to adhere to prevailing social expectations and  follow the professional and occupational paths established by their predecessors   (Erazo - Borras  et al., 2021). . This pressure can have a significant impact on their ed ucational decisions and  their motivation to continue their university studies. Experiencing the expectation of fulfilling  the traditional model of rural life, some students may question the relevance and value of  university education in the context of thei r community   (Reategui et al., 2020).  Also, in these communities, the lack of representation of role models who have pursued  higher education may limit the perception of the possibilities offered by higher education. The  absence of individuals in leadersh ip roles or professionals with university backgrounds may

In  terms of geographic and access barriers, it was id entified that distances to universities and lack  of adequate transportation can discourage students from rural areas and make it difficult for  them to attend classes regularly. Likewise, insufficient educational infrastructure can limit  access to resources   and enriching learning opportunities.  Finally, cultural and social aspects, such as social expectations and family pressures,  can influence the determination to continue or abandon higher education. Gender stereotypes  also affect women's participation in   higher education.  To address this problem, it is essential to suggest lines of action that promote equal  opportunities and strengthen student retention in rural universities, as well as to establish  educational policies that address socioeconomic inequalit ies and promote access to resources  and support services.  SUGGESTIONS  In order to promote greater equity of opportunity and strengthen student retention in rural  universities, several strategies and educational policies are propo sed. First, it is essential to  establish scholarship and financial support programs aimed at students with limited economic  resources, with the objective of alleviating the economic burden and facilitating their access to  and permanence in higher education .  Likewise, priority should be given to the development of educational infrastructure in rural  areas, guaranteeing the availability of libraries, laboratories and updated technology to enrich  the learning process and provide students with an adequate and f avorable educational  environment to ensure student retention. On the other hand, another relevant measure is the  training and support to teachers of rural universities, through training and updating programs,  to optimize the quality of instruction and ensu re adequate support to students.  In addition, it is important to promote relevant academic programs linked to local needs, in  order to offer educational options aligned with job opportunities and regional development. In  terms of technology, it is proposed   to facilitate access to digital resources and online tools in  rural areas, in order to overcome technological limitations that may affect the educational  process.  To promote a shared understanding of the relevance of higher education, it is necessary to c arry  out awareness campaigns aimed at the community and families, highlighting the personal and  community benefits of access to quality education.  These are just some of the suggestions among many others that could be implemented to address  the dropout of   students in rural universities and promote equal opportunities in these areas. It is  crucial that education policy makers and university institutions work together to design  comprehensive strategies tailored to the specific needs of each rural community. O ngoing  research and analysis of the elements that influence student dropout will identify new  opportunities   for   improvement   and   ensure   equitable   access   to   higher   education,   thus  contributing to the academic, professional and social development of rural stu dents and  strengthening the educational fabric of these regions. Together, these suggestions seek to  strengthen student retention and provide equitable educational opportunities in rural areas, thus  contributing to greater equality of opportunities and the   integral development of these  communities.

Fostering   E quity in Rural Education: a Literature   R eview on Student Dropout and Retention Strategies  ___________________________________________________________________________  Rev. Gest. Soc. Ambient. |   Miami   |   v.1 8 .n. 1   |   p. 1 - 18   |   e0 4922   |   202 4 .  3  However, it is pertinent to note that not all students have equal access to these high - level  academic institutions, as there are significant dis parities between rural and urban areas (Ortega  & Solano, 2002; Ortega & Solano, 2003).   (Ortega & Solano, 2023).  In the context of education, rural areas often face specific challenges that hinder the  availability of excellent education. Lack of resources , limited infrastructure and shortage of  teaching staff are just some of the difficulties faced by rural learners. These limitations can  affect the development of the skills required to access and remain in higher education, creating  a significant gap in e ducational opportunities between urban and rural areas.  Higher education, in particular, plays a vital role in the social mobility and economic  growth of individuals and communities. Universities and colleges offer varied academic  programs, providing stud ents with the opportunity to specialize in various areas and acquire the  skills required to enter the job market. However, despite its importance, higher education  remains inaccessible to many young people living in rural areas   (Valero et al., 2022).  Educa tion in rural areas is characterized by its particular context, where students often  face additional challenges   (Ortega & Solano, 2023). . Geographic distances, lack of adequate  transportation, and limited cultural and social opportunities can negatively   impact learners'  motivation and dedication. Added to that, socioeconomic and cultural factors can also influence  learners' decisions to abandon higher education in search of other alternatives, such as early  insertion into the labor market or migration to   urban areas   (Charry, 2019).  It is in this complex scenario that the problem of student dropout from rural universities  arises. Attrition refers to the premature abandonment of higher education studies by educadnos  before completing their academic program s   (Carvajal & Cervantes, 2017). . This phenomenon,  widely studied and debated in the educational literature, represents a significant obstacle to  development and equity of opportunities in rural areas.  Various studies and research have examined the reaso ns for and effects of student  dropout in rural universities. Individual factors, such as lack of family support, lack of intrinsic  motivation and insecurity in academic ability, intertwine with contextual factors, such as  economic barriers and scarcity of   job opportunities, to form a complex web of influences that  lead learners to drop out of higher education in rural areas   (Barrantes - Morales et al 2021).  Based on the arguments in the preceding paragraphs, this study will conduct an analysis  of the existing   literature on the dropout of students from rural universities. The most relevant  studies   that   explain   this   phenomenon   will   be   examined,   with   the   objective   of   better  understanding   the   underlying   causes   and   proposing   suggestions   to   promote   equity   of  opportu nities in rural areas and strengthen student retention.  2   LITERATURE REVIEW  In this section, a review of previous research related to the study variables is addressed,  where academic studies are examined as relevant sources for understanding the underlyi ng  causes of this phenomenon. Student dropout from rural universities is a major problem affecting  rural communities around the world. College dropouts are less likely to find well - paid  employment, and are more likely to live in poverty   (Barrantes - Morales   et al., 2021).  There are a variety of factors that contribute to the dropout of rural university students,  including lack of access to educational resources, lack of family and community support, lack  of motivation, among others. In this regard, it is rele vant to highlight the research conducted  by.   Zambrano et al. (2018) which focused on investigating the causes of student dropout in rural  university centers in Latin America. The results revealed that socioeconomic, educational and  psychological factors e xert a significant influence on this phenomenon. In addition, it was found  that the implementation of retention and continuous follow - up measures during the university  career contributes to a significant reduction in dropout at that level in other countrie s.

Next, an analysis is made of the aspects implicit in the existing literature on student  dropout   from   rural   universities,   focusing   on   four   main   categories:   a)   individual   and  socioeconomic factors, b) geographic and access barriers, c) quality of education a nd available  resources, and d) cultural and social aspects. These categories have been selected in order to  comprehensively and   comprehensively address   the research topic, considering different  dimensions and factors influencing student dropout in rural se ttings.  4.1   Individual and socioeconomic factors  Individual and socioeconomic factors play a fundamental role in the dropout of rural  university students. These personal and contextual aspects can influence the determination to  drop out and affect studen t retention in rural environments. Socioeconomic status, family  support, motivation, educational and career aspirations are some of the factors that have been

Fostering   E quity in Rural Education: a Literature   R eview on Student Dropout and Retention Strategies  ___________________________________________________________________________  Rev. Gest.

Recognition of these factors is essential to better understand the  un derlying causes of college dropout in rural settings.  In this sense, in the first place, the socioeconomic level of the student has been identified  as an influential factor in the dropout of students from rural universities.   Castro - Montoya et al.  (2021)   have   found   that   those   students   who   come   from   disadvantaged   socioeconomic  backgrounds face greater difficulties in financing their higher education, which in turn increases  the probability of dropping out.  Lack of financial resources directly impacts a lea rner's ability to meet the expenses  associated with education, such as tuition, the purchase of books and materials, transportation  costs, and housing. These financial challenges can create an additional burden for rural students,  especially when they do n ot have the financial support to cover these costs ( Nierotka et al 2023).  In addition, economic constraints can make it difficult to access support services and  academic   resources   that   are   critical   to   student   success.   For   example,   students   from  socioecono mically disadvantaged backgrounds may have less access to tutoring programs,  academic advising, or student wellness services that are vital to their academic and personal  development   (Nishat et al., 2020; Varela et al., 2022). .  Importantly, the impact of   socioeconomic status is not only limited to financial aspects,  but can also influence how learners perceive their own abilities   (Cocoradă et al., 2021). . Lack  of financial resources can generate a sense of inequality and limit students' academic and car eer  expectations, which in turn can undermine their motivation and engagement in higher  education, therefore, it is crucial to adopt measures and policies that address these inequities  and provide equitable opportunities for rural students, thus promoting   higher retention and  academic success   (Nishat et al., 2020). .  In addition, family support plays a crucial role in the educational journey of rural  university students. The presence of a favorable family environment, characterized by  emotional support, va luing education and encouragement towards higher studies has been  associated with higher student retention   (Rueda et al., 2020).  When students have strong family support, they feel emotionally supported in their  pursuit of higher education, which can lea d to a greater sense of self - confidence and motivation  to persevere in their studies despite the challenges they may face   (Rueda et al., 2020) . Emotional  support from the family can provide them with the necessary support to overcome academic  and personal   obstacles, strengthening their commitment to education and reducing the  likelihood of dropout   (Aldowah et al., 2020) . Therefore, when the family values education and  conveys this message to students, an environment conducive to academic development is  crea ted, because students recognize the significance assigned to education within their family  environment and this positively influences their motivation and commitment to higher  education. The recognition that the family gives to education can function as a   protective factor  against dropout, since students feel driven to achieve their academic goals and meet family  expectations (Gonzales & Evaristo, 2002).   (Gonzales & Evaristo, 2021).  On the other hand, the lack of family support can have negative consequen ces in the  educational journey of rural university students. The absence of a family environment that  emotionally   supports   their   academic   efforts   can   generate   feelings   of   demotivation,  disengagement   and   isolation.   Without   the   necessary   support,   learners   ma y   experience  difficulties in coping with academic and emotional challenges, increasing the likelihood of  dropping out of university studies   (Chalela - Naffah et al., 2020). .  Motivation is another crucial factor that influences rural learners' persistence i n higher  education ( Flanagan, 2017) . Research has consistently shown that the absence of internal  motivation, i.e., the lack of a genuine interest in learning and obtaining a degree can contribute  to student dropout   (Barragán & González - Támara, 2017) . When   students lack intrinsic  motivation, they may experience difficulties in fully committing to their studies. The lack of a

These ad ditional costs can further  hinder access to college education and increase the likelihood of attrition.  Similarly, the time spent commuting can also negatively impact rural college students  (Riquelme, 2017) . The extensive distances they must travel to re ach the university can involve  hours   of   daily   commuting,   which   reduces   the   time   available   to   study,   participate   in  extracurricular activities and rest adequately, generating physical and mental exhaustion, and,  therefore, affecting academic performance and   student motivation.  Another important aspect that impacts the dropout of rural university students is the lack  of flexibility in public or private transportation schedules, which can make it difficult to  reconcile class schedules with available transporta tion schedules. Some learners may find  themselves in situations where there is not an adequate match between transportation schedules  and their class schedules, which can result in delays, absences, and difficulties in meeting  academic commitments   (Urbina - Nájera et al., 2021). . This lack of synchronization can generate  additional stress and affect student retention.  In addition, the lack of synchronization between transportation schedules and class  schedules can create difficulties in meeting academic com mitments. Rural students may find  themselves in situations where they must choose between attending classes or using available  transportation to return home. This trade - off can be especially challenging for those students  who rely on public transportation,   as schedules may be limited and may not allow them to attend  all of their classes on a regular basis   (Mohammadi et al., 2018) . These difficulties related to the  lack of flexibility in transportation schedules can have a significant impact on student reten tion.  Students who are consistently late or miss classes due to transportation issues may feel  demotivated and experience a sense of disengagement with their education  Along the same lines, the lack of adequate transportation also aff ects rural students. The lack  of reliable and affordable private public transportation options can hinder the daily commute to  and from universities, generating difficulties in meeting class schedules and increasing the  economic burden for students who pay   for their own transportation   (Herrera & Rivera, 2020) .  The additional cost of transportation can further limit their available resources to cover other  educational and daily expenses, increasing the likelihood of dropout.  On the other hand, insufficient   educational infrastructure is another significant obstacle  contributing to student dropout from rural universities   (Alao & Brink, 2022) . The lack of  adequate facilities, such as libraries, laboratories, and study spaces, can limit access to enriching  lear ning resources and opportunities, affecting the quality of education and hindering the active  involvement of learners in their academic training process   (Kalsoom et al., 2022).  The lack of well - equipped libraries limits access to study materials and up - to - date  information sources, which can hinder the development of research skills and the acquisition of  relevant knowledge   (Partridge et al., 2021) . Rural students may face difficulties in accessing  books, scientific journals, or other academic sources releva nt to their training. This lack of  access to up - to - date bibliographic resources can limit their ability to delve deeper into topics of  study and to keep up with advances in their academic field.  The lack of adequate laboratories and study spaces also repre sents a negative impact.  The lack of laboratories equipped with state - of - the - art technology can hinder the development  of practical and experimental skills necessary for certain disciplines, limiting their exposure to  relevant practical experiences and aff ecting their preparation for the labor field   (Regmi & Jones,  2020) . Similarly, the lack of adequate study spaces also hinders the active involvement of  learners in their academic training process, affecting concentration, group work and interaction  with pe ers and professors, and, consequently, decreases students' motivation and responsibility  with their university studies.  These limitations in educational infrastructure can lead to the dropout of rural university  students. The lack of resources and enrichin g learning opportunities can lead to dissatisfaction,

Therefore, it is necessary to create orientation  and a wareness programs aimed at rural students and their families, focused on highlighting the  benefits   and   opportunities   offered   by   college   education.   These   programs   can   provide  information   on   professional   careers   that   align   with   the   traditions   and   needs   of   ru ral  communities, demonstrating that higher education can coexist and enrich the local social and  economic fabric   (Barba, 2020) .  Similarly, family pressures can be a determinant factor in student dropout in rural  universities   (Lozano   &   Maldonado,   2020). .   In   some   rural   communities,   families   are  economically dependent on students' work, which can generate pressure for them to leave  college and engage in work activities that contribute to the family income. For some rural  students, higher education may be p erceived as a luxury or a long - term investment, which may  conflict   with   the   immediate   economic   needs   of   their   families.   Lack   of   support   and  understanding from loved ones may discourage students, making them feel guilty or responsible  for contributing finan cially to the household, even if this means abandoning their studies.  This situation is exacerbated in cases where local employment opportunities are limited  and migration to urban areas is not a viable option for everyone   (Ruiz, 2019) . In such  circumsta nces, rural students may face a dilemma between duty to their family and the desire  to pursue higher education that offers them greater long - term opportunities.  On the other hand, cultural expectations around gender may have an impact on women's  determinat ion to drop out of higher education   (González - Ramírez & Pedraza - Navarro, 2017). .  In some rural communities, ingrained stereotypes persist that assign traditional roles to women,  relegating them primarily to caring for the home and family   (Mascheroni, 202 1) . Expectations  that women devote themselves to home and family care can limit their opportunities to continue  their education, which can lead to higher student dropout among this group, in addition, social  pressure to conform to these expectations can ge nerate internal conflict and difficulties in  making decisions that challenge established norms.  Along the same lines, gender constraints can also manifest themselves in the unequal  distribution of resources and educational opportunities for women and men i n rural settings  (Chávez et al., 2020). . Women may face additional obstacles in accessing specific study  programs, leadership opportunities or spaces for participation in extracurricular activities that  can enrich their educational experience, making it   necessary to promote gender equality and  equal opportunities in access to and participation in higher education   (Fernández et al., 2023).  Ultimately, addressing cultural expectations around gender and promoting equity of  opportunity in higher education wil l help reduce student dropout among women in rural settings  and foster a more inclusive and equitable future for all.  In summary, cultural and social aspects play a significant role in rural college students'  determination to leave higher education. Commun ity norms, social expectations, family  pressures, and gender stereotypes can influence learners' perceptions and decisions about their  education. It is essential to address these issues and promote an educational culture that values  and supports university   education as a means for individual development and the advancement  of rural communities.  5   CONCLUSIONS  After examining the literature on student dropout in rural universities, it has become  evident that there are various factors   that influence this complex phenomenon. In the first place,  the importance of the socioeconomic level of the students stands out, since those from  disadvantaged families face greater difficulties in paying for their studies, which increases the  risk of dro pping out of university.

The   objective  was to understand a complex phenomenon that represents a major obstacle to development and equal opportunities  in the rural educational context.  Theoretical framework:   Different scientific publications were reviewed in all the academic platforms   with the  highest impact in the scientific field. This allowed the researchers to broaden their knowledge and, ultimately, to  deepen their understanding of the subject studied in this work.  Design/Methodology/Approach:   The methodology of the study include d a documentary review, with content  analysis as the main strategy. The databases Scopus, Redalyc, SciELO Dialnet and Google Scholar were used,  with specific inclusion criteria related to the period of publication, type of study, languages and availability   in  open format.  Findings:   The data found revealed that university dropout occurs due to various situations, such as individual and  socioeconomic factors, geographic and access barriers, quality of education and available resources. In addition,  cultural   and social aspects, and sometimes the lack of empathy on the part of authorities, professors and peers,  cause university dropouts.  Social, practical and research implications:   The study has important implications for understanding and  reducing dropout in   the rural university context, which will have implications for areas such as education, policy  and social development.  Originality/value:   It is crucial that education policy makers and university institutions work in a coordinated  manner to design compreh ensive strategies tailored to the specific needs of each rural community. Continued  research and analysis of the elements that influence dropout will identify new opportunities for improvement and  1   Universidad César Vallejo, Trujillo, La Libertad, Perú.
